This directory contains the start of an ACAP API.  It's still somewhat
in flux, so if you build applications on top of it, be prepared to
change it.

Eventually, we'd like to see an API be layered as follows:

- connection-level (communicates with a single ACAP server)

- session-level (augments connection-level with ability to manage
		 multiple servers)

- caching (allows for caching results on local machine, 
	   disconnection operations. possible no server functionality.)

On top of the generic caching API would be per-dataset interfaces, so
if a programmer needs "options", they can just use the options API and
not even have to think about ACAP.  (Similiarly for addressbooks,
bookmarks, etc.)

What you'll find here is the start of the lowest level.
