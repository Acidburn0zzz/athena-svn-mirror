This is a development version of CySNIIP, our extensible application
instrumentation framework.  Eventually, it'll probably be pulled out into
it's own package.  It may also be more tightly integrated with UCD SNMP
at some point.

Currently, it's written to the AgentX API, and has been tested against the
CMU SNMP library.
