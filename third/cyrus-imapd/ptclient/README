This directory contains support programs for various protection database
authorization modules (ptloader for AFS PTS groups, and hopefully an ldaploader
soon).

This code links against the rest of the cyrus libraries.

The files to care about:

ptloader: the AFS pts server loader service
ptexpire: program to expire pts entries on command
ptdump: program to dump the current cache
