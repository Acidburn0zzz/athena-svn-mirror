On RedHat systems, /usr/bin/netscape is a wrapper script. If Netscape
is already running, it opens a new window instead of starting another
instance. This causes some problems with Xalf. The solution is to
modify /usr/bin/netscape to call "xalfoff" before opening the new
window. An modified version of this script is included.

An patch against the original /usr/bin/netscape is also included. It
was made from the version included in RedHats package
netscape-common-4.77-0.6.2.
