Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q1. When starting Xmms a second time, the indicator shows for 20 seconds. 
A1. This is because Xmms by default doesn't allow multiple instances running at
the same time. If you want multiple instances, edit ~/.xmms/config and
make sure allow_multiple_instances is set to TRUE. If you want to
control an already running instances even when running xmms through
xalf, you can create an wrapper script like this:

#!/bin/sh
if [ -S /tmp/xmms_${USER}.0 ]; then
 xalfoff
 /usr/bin/xmms $*
else
 /usr/bin/xmms $*
fi
 
Q2. When launching a second instance of Netscape, the indicator shows
for 20 seconds (timeout). 
A2. On RedHat systems, /usr/bin/netscape is a shellscript that opens a
new window instead of starting a new process. By making some small
changes to this script (so that xalfoff is called), one can get the
desired behavior. A patched script is included as extras/netscape.

Q3. (GNOME without using build-in hooks) Running terminalbased
applications with Xalf from Gnome via "Run in terminal" option behaves
strange.
A3. This is because the command executed is:

xterm -e xalf <command>

It should be:

xalf xterm -e <command>

Do not use "Run in terminal" option, but the second form. 

Q4. One of my applications crashes when run via Xalf. 
A4. This has been observed with Acrobat Reader 4.00 and Applixware
4.3. Acrobat Reader 4.05 and newer versions of Applixware seems to
work fine. I'm not sure if these problems are caused by bugs in the
applications or if Xalf is doing something bad. Please report all
crashes or other Xalf related problems. 

Q5. When launching gmc or gnome-terminal, the indicator shows
for 20 seconds (timeout). 
A5. These applications does not start new processes, but creates new
windows. Change "Exec=gmc" in /usr/share/gnome/apps/Gmc.desktop to
"Exec=NO_XALF gmc". In
/usr/share/gnome/apps/System/gnome-terminal.desktop, set 
"NO_XALF Exec=gnome-terminal --use-factory --start-factory-server" or "Exec=gnome-terminal".
