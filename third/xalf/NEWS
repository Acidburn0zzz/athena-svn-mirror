Version 0.4, 2000-06-18
-----------------------
 * Added GNOME Control Center capplet. 

 * New indicator: Animated star, by Martin Engel <m.engel@ndh.net>. 


Version 0.3, 2000-06-01
-----------------------
 * Added option --title

 * If LD_PRELOAD is already set upon Xalf start, it is appended. This
   means that Xalf now should work well even if LD_PRELOAD is
   needed for other purposes. 

   Not all systems support this. Probably, it only works on systems
   running a recent version of ld-linux.so.

 * New hourglass splashscreen, thanks to Tuomas Kuosmanen
   <tigert@gimp.org>. 

 * XALF_LAUNCH_ID is removed from started applications environment,
   eg. should be invisible. 

 
Version 0.2, 2000-04-14	
-----------------------
 * Total code rewrite. 

 * Overloads XMapWindow instead of XCreateWindow. 

 * Uses a environment variable called XALF_LAUNCH_PID with the pid of
 the tracking xalf process. XMapWindow, when called, sends an signal
 to this process. 

 * Optionally uses "mappingmode" instead of the LD_PRELOAD approach. In
 this mode MapNotify events are detected. In this mode, it's not
 possible to distinguish between created windows. This mode is useful
 for applications requiring exclusive control over the LD_PRELOAD
 variable, such as StarOffice 5.1. 

 * Uses GNU getopt for option parsing. 

 * Check if unsetenv() is available. Use putenv() if it doesn't
 exist. 

 * Launch timeout. 

 * Build system uses Automake, Autoconf and Libtool. 

 * Three different indicators available: invisible window,
 splashscreen and mouse cursor change. 

 * Detects if launched application is setuid/setgid, and automatically
 use --mappingmode if this is the case. 

 * Detects if LD_PRELOAD is already set, and automatically
 use --mappingmode if this is the case. 

 * Detects if libxalflaunch.so if available, and automatically use
 --mappingmode if the library is not available. 

 * Catches SIGTERM, SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals, and restores changed
 cursor upon these signals.
