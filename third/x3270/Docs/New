x3270 Version 3.1.1 -- New Features and Bug Fixes

x3270 3.1.1.3 is functionally identical to x3270 3.1.0.7, with the following
exceptions:

IND$FILE File Transfer Support

File transfer with IBM hosts is now supported using the IND$FILE protocol. A
new File menu item, File Transfer, initiates a transfer.

The IND$FILE program must be installed on the IBM host, and the 3270 cursor
must be positioned on a field which can accept a TSO or VM/CMS command.

A pop-up menu allows the file names and transfer options to be specified.

Both types of file transfer are supported and automatically recognized: CUT,
expanding the data into displayable characters a screenful at a time, and
DFT, exchanging binary data with Structured Fields.

This code was created in collaboration with Dick Altenbern.
