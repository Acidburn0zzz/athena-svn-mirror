>If you want to get seriously involved with GNOME, you
      really have to join the gnome-list mailing list (See <A
HREF="mailinglist.html"
>Mailing Lists</A
>, above).  Check the
      list of mailing lists to see what other lists interest you.
      Also, make sure you read the GNOME Manifesto at <A
HREF="http://www.gnome.org/about/manifesto.shtml"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.gnome.org/about/manifesto.shtml</A
> and the articles
      on the GNU Project Philosophy at <A
HREF="http://gnu.org/philosophy"
TARGET="_top"
>http://gnu.org/philosophy</A
> to make sure you know
      what kind of project you're getting involved in.  You don't have
      to agree with all of the philosophy in order to contribute to
      GNOME, but at least respect that some of us are committed to the
      ideas given in these documents.</P

>Since GNOME is a software project, we obviously can always
      use more programmers, but you don't have to be a programmer to
      help out with GNOME.  We also can always use more people sending
      in clear bug reports.  There is always more documentation to be
      written.  If you speak more than one language, we can always use
      translators, both of the documentation and of the labels,
      buttons and menu entries within the applications.  People
      willing to make binary packages for their system are quite
      welcome, particularly if nobody else is making binaries yet for
      that system.  People willing and able to mirror our WWW, FTP
      and/or CVS servers are enthusiastically encouraged to do
      so.</P
