>If you are developing for GNOME, or if you just want to
      keep more up-to-date than the latest release, you should
      consider using our CVS system.  There is the main CVS server,
      which you need an account for, and a network of mirrors of the
      server, which anyone can read from.  This network of mirrors is
      collectively called Anonymous CVS, and they all can be accessed
      at anoncvs.gnome.org (they are set up with round-robin DNS to
      balance out the load).  If you are looking to contribute source
      code to the GNOME project, you will eventually want an account
      on the main CVS server, but get used to the Anonymous CVS system
      first, so you are familiar with how GNOME makes use of
      CVS.</P

>Directions on how to access the Anonymous CVS system are at
      <A

>http://www.gnome.org/devel/whatiscvs.shtml</A

      a very useful guide at <A
HREF="http://www.cinternet.net/~soren/gnome/cvs.shtml"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.cinternet.net/~soren/gnome/cvs.shtml</A
>.  The anonymous CVS
      servers should be updating themselves </P
><P
>In order to use the CVS version, you need to have GNU
      tools installed on your system.  You need at least GNU Autoconf,
      Automake, Libtool and m4.  If your system doesn't include these,
      you can get them from the GNU website at <A
