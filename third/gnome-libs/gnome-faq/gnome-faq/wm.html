>A window manager is a program within the X Windows
      environment which controls the placement and appearance of
      windows on the screen.  Look at an xterm or something.  The box
      of terminal text is the actual xterm, the border, title bar,
      buttons and so forth are all handled by the window manager.
      Some window managers have extra features, but all handle window
      placement and decoration.</P

>There are many window managers out there, and GNOME should
      work well with all of them.  There are a few GNOME features
      (such as session management, and the GNOME pager), that won't
      work with all of them.  For best results, go with a
      GNOME-compliant window manager.  The two most compliant are
      currently Enlightenment and IceWM, with FVWM, SCWM, Window
      Maker, AfterStep and QVWM putting finishing touches on
      GNOME-compliance as we speak.</P
