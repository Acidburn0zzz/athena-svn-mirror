></H2
><P
>From the GNU gettext info page:</P
><P
>By <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>internationalization</I
>, one
	refers to the operation by which a program, or a set of
	programs turned into a package, is made aware and able to
	support multiple languages. This is a generalization process,
	by which the programs are untied from using only English
	strings or other English specific habits, and connected to
	generic ways of doing the same, instead. Program developers
	may use various techniques to internationalize their programs,
	some of them have been standardized. GNU gettext offers one of
	these standards.</P
><P
>By <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>localization</I
>, one means the
	operation by which, in a set of programs already
	internationalized, one gives the program all needed
	information so that it can bend itself to handle its input and
	output in a fashion which is correct for some native language
	and cultural habits. This is a particularisation process, by
	which generic methods already implemented in an
	internationalized program are used in specific ways. The
	programming environment puts several functions to the
	programmers disposal which allow this runtime
	configuration. The formal description of specific set of
	cultural habits for some country, together with all associated
	translations targeted to the same native language, is called
	the locale for this language or country. Users achieve
	localization of programs by setting proper values to special
	environment variables, prior to executing those programs,
	identifying which locale should be used.</P

>GNOME uses the Uniforum's internationalization
	standard. This is the "standard" invented by Sun Microsystems
	and adopted by the GNU project in their "gettext"
	package. N.b., this is different from the competing X/Open
	standard.</P

>How do I change the language of my GNOME
	programs?</A
></H2
><P
>To change the language that GNOME programs use, you just
	need to set the environment variable <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LANG</TT
> to
	the desired ISO 639 language code.  From that point forward,
	any new GNOME apps you run will try use that language.</P
><P
>Let's say you wanted to see GNOME in Spanish.  In the
	Bourne Shell and its derivatives (such as Bash), you use
	<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>set LANG="es"</B
>.  If you were using the C
	Shell (or tcsh), you would use <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>setenv LANG
	"es"</B
> instead.  These commands are generally put in
	the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.profile</TT
> or
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>.login</TT
> file, so that your environment
	starts up the same way each time.</P
><P
>Some languages (such as English and Spanish) need to be
	handled differently depending on where you are.  In these
	cases you can extend the language code with an underscore
	followed by a ISO 3166 country code.  So, if you want to
	select British English you would use "en_GB"; for Mexican
	Spanish you would use "es_MX".</P
><P
>Keep in mind that GNOME apps that are already running
	won't change languages while you change the
	<TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LANG</TT
> variable, you have to close the program
	and reopen it for the new value to take effect.  Also note
	that some languages are not offered by all applications.  You
	might find some apps using the language you want, and others
	using English.</P
