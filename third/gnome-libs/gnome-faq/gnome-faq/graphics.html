>GTK+ is the interface which GNOME applications use to
	interact with the user. It is similar to the role of Motif in
	CDE, Qt in KDE or the-widget-set-which-has-no-name in

>You are encouraged to add bindings to other languages
	should the fancy strike you. N.b., that the Scheme bindings
	already have a formalized representation of the API, so if you
	want to start working on new bindings, then you might want to
	start from here.</P
><P
>Having written that, I have to wonder if we can't
	somehow use CORBA to cut this Gordian knot. If the ORBit
	developers can get the cost of a local CORBA call down to that
	of a normal shared-library call, then why not CORBify GTK and
	work on adding bindings for new languages to ORBit? I know,
	the conventional wisdom is that CORBA is too heavyweight for
	high-volume stuff like X calls.  Hey, don't blame me for
	throwing out crazy ideas: the reason I maintain the FAQ is
	that I can't program!</P

NAME="IMLIB"
>What is imlib?</A
></H2
><P
>Along with GTK, GNOME uses imlib, an image library for X
	which supports multiple image formats transparently to the
	programmer. Imlib can even use external converter programs
	like ImageMagick or pmbplus to convert unknown image formats
	to known formats, so if a converter exists for an image type,
	you can almost certainly use that image type in your
	application! Imlib also supports multiple bit-depths, from
	24-bit down to 1-bit monochrome, again transparently to the
	programmer, and does intelligent color map allocation and
	automatic dithering to get the best possible performance out
	of your display. Anyone who has ever tried to do this in their
	X apps, or who has had to endure their screen flashing when
	apps have to allocate a private color map, you will especially
	like this feature.</P

NAME="THEMES"
>What's the deal with themes?</A
></H2
><P
>Themes let you change the look and feel of GTK+
	applications without recompiling them.  With themes, you are
	able to change the theme of all GTK+ apps on a given display
	at the same time.</P
><P
>There are actually two parts of a theme in GTK+, the
	engine and the configuration.  The engine is a specially
	constructed shared library with instructions on the themes way
	to draw the widgets (the controls of a window, like the
	buttons, scrollbars and menus).  The configuration includes
	information like fonts, colors, which engine to use, and
	sometimes graphic images to incorporate into the theme.
	Together, the two make the Theme, and give GTK+ its flexible
	appearance.</P

>To see some examples of what themed GTK+ apps look like,
	take a look at: <A

>How do I get themes working?</A
></H2
><P
>First, you need a recent version of GTK+, I recommend
	version 1.2.1 at the moment, but 1.2.0 works fine as well.
	You then get the themes you want.  A good selection of themes
	is available in the gtk-engines module.  Even more are
	available at <A
HREF="http://gtk.themes.org"
TARGET="_top"
>	http://gtk.themes.org</A
>.</P
><P
>Many of the themes include an engine.  You need to
	compile the engine, and install it.  In gtk-engines, this is
	done the same way as any GNOME module.  The themes from the
	website might have different instructions, check their
	documentation.  Some of the themes on the website are merely
	alternate configurations for another engine, many of them are
	for the pixmap engine in gtk-engines.</P
><P
>Once the theme is installed, you can select them through
	the GNOME Control Center, under Desktop-&#62;Theme Selector.  The
	selector will allow you to choose between all the themes
	installed on the fly, preview what the the theme will look
	like, and in version 1.04 or later even let you select the
	font.</P

NAME="OPENGL"
>What is OpenGL?</A
></H2
><P
>OpenGL is a 2D and 3D rendering API developed by Silicon
	Graphics that has become a de facto industry standard.
	Basically, it is a tool to take a viewpoint of 3D space, and
	produce a 2D image of it suitable for drawing on a screen. To
	quote SGI's FAQ:</P
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="BLOCKQUOTE"
><P
>OpenGL is a rendering only, vendor neutral API
	  providing 2D and 3D graphics functions, including modeling,
	  transformations, color, lighting, smooth shading, as well as
	  advanced features like texture mapping, NURBS, fog, alpha
	  blending and motion blur. OpenGL works in both immediate and
	  retained (display list) graphics modes.</P
></BLOCKQUOTE
><P
>GNOME uses an implementation of the OpenGL API called
	Mesa.  Mesa is not OpenGL per se, since it is a Free Software
	project that has not gone through the OpenGL trademark
	licensing process, but it is a faithful representation of the
	OpenGL API.  Mesa is not OpenGL(tm) in precisely the same way
	that GNU/Linux and FreeBSD are not Unix(tm).</P
