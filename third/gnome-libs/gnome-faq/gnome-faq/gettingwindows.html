>Currently the answer is no, GNOME hasn't been ported to
      the Windows platform, there is an effort going on to make such a
      port possible.  If you really really need a version for Windows,
      count on doing lots of work and coordinating with related efforts.</P

>Tor Lillqvist has been porting several graphical libraries
      used by GNOME to the Win32 (Microsoft Windows 95/98/NT)
      platform.  More info on his efforts can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32</A
>.  He's already ported
      glib, gtk+, gdk_imlib, and a few other libraries involved in
      generating graphics to Win32.</P
><P
>His goal is to get Gimp working fully on the platform (it
      already works partially), but his work brings GNOME much closer
      to being portable to Windows.  A number of GNOME applications
      need just his libraries (possibly with some more debugging),
      libpng, gnome-libs and ORBit.  If someone were to port these,
      many GNOME applications could be compiled and run on
      Windows.</P
><P
>If you are interested in working on such a project, make
      sure to carefully read the documentation of <A
HREF="http://gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html"
TARGET="_top"
> Autoconf</A
>, since that's how we
      differentiate between different system capabilities in GNOME.
      Also, take a close look at Cygnus Solution's <A

>CygWin32</A
>
      libraries and utilities.  They will make such a task much
      easier.</P
