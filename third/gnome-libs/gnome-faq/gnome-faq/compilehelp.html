></H2
><P
>In general, it means that it is having trouble finding
	or linking to the compression library (libz).  First, make
	sure it is installed.  If it isn't, then find it and install
	it.  It should be included in all major Unixes and Unix-like
	systems.</P
><P
>If it is installed properly, and you still get the
	error, than check to see if there are any other copies of libz
	floating around.  One place where it often is hiding when
	people have problems is in
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/X11R6/lib</TT
>, since XFree86 puts a copy
	there.  It is probably safe to just delete it, but if you
	aren't sure, rename it to something like
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libz.so.renamed</TT
>, that way it won't be
	found by the linker, and if you run into problems elsewhere
	because of the renaming, you can just rename it back.</P

>What is <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>AC_TRY_RUN</TT
>,
	and why is my machine warning me about it?</A
></H2
><P
>Sometimes, when running aclocal, autogen.sh or make, you
	will get lines looking like: <TT
CLASS="COMPUTEROUTPUT"
>configure.in:171:
	warning: AC_TRY_RUN called without default to allow cross
	compiling</TT
>.  This is nothing to be alarmed
	about, you can safely ignore it (unless you are cross
	compiling).</P
><P
>If you're still curious, a cross compiler is a compiler
	based on one platform that you can use to create code to run
	on a different platform.  For example, some people have a
	version of GCC installed on GNU/Linux boxes with Intel
	processors which makes binaries for SGI boxes with MIPS
	processors.  This would be a cross compiler.</P
><P
>The AC_TRY_RUN macro is called to attempt to compile and
	run a code fragment.  It is used to test to see whether a
	particular piece of code is likely to work on your machine or
	not, and adjust the configuration accordingly.  If you are
	cross-compiling, however, you can't run the code fragment,
	since it's on a different machine than the one you are on.
	The AC_TRY_RUN macro includes a parameter to tell it what to
	do in this case, but we haven't tested cross-compiling GNOME
	yet, so it would be premature to configure this value.
	Because the value is absent, it gives the warning.</P
