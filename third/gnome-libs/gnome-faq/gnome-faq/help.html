	do?</A

><P
>OK, first thing you do is pause, relax, and take a deep
	breath.  Next, look through this FAQ, the Users Guide, and any
	other documentation you have handy and see if any of it comes
	close to solving your problem.  Next, look through the mailing
	list archives (instructions are given <A
HREF="archives.html"
>above</A
>) to see if someone else talks
	about your problem.  Then try whatever it was you were doing
	<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>one more time</I
> to see if the solution
	suddenly presents itself.  If none of that works, it's time to
	ask on the list.</P
><P
>First of all, you are subscribed to gnome-list, right?
	If you aren't, instructions on how to subscribe are given
	<A
HREF="mailinglist.html"
>above</A
>.  Now, when asking
	for help on GNOME-list, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>give lots of
	detail</I
>.  Posting <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"The panel doesn't work,
	this sucks!"</SPAN
> doesn't help you or us.  You still have
	the problem, and we have a possible bug which we have no
	information about.  It is more useful (but still not
	sufficient) to say <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Whenever I select the foo item from
	the Foot menu, the entire panel disappears suddenly; by the
	way, what is this file that GNOME keeps putting in my home
	directory, it's called <A
HREF="help.html#CORE"
>core</A
>."</SPAN
></P
><P
>Ideally, we need several pieces of information from
	you. First, exactly what kind of system are you running on?
	No, not everyone runs the same operating system you are using.
	We need processor type: Sparc, MIPS, i386 (this includes
	Pentiums, AMD, Cyrix, etc), PPC, Alpha, ARM, 680x0, et al; we
	need operating system: Linux distribution, FreeBSD, HURD,
	OpenBSD, Solaris, IRIX, CrayOS, OS/400, whatever.  Also
	include the version of the operating system. For example, the
	machine I'm on right now is a GNU/Linux RedHat/i386 Rawhide
	machine, a friend of mine uses a Solaris Sparc 2.6
	machine.</P
><P
>Next, we need some relevant vital statistics of what is
	on your system.  On a GNU/Linux system, the kernel and libc
	version numbers are almost always relevant.  On almost all
	GNOME problems we need your glib, gtk+, Imlib, ORBit and
	gnome-libs versions.  If you aren't sure if you need any of
	the above, include them anyway.  Other things that are
	sometimes relevant are versions of Perl, X11, Python, Guile
	and libpng, unless you see an error message that mentions one
	of them, you can leave them out.  Also important is how you
	installed GNOME.  Did you use binaries, if so which ones?  Did
	you use tarballs?  Did you use CVS, if so which dates and/or
	tags?  If you used a mixture of the above, tell us.</P
><P
>Lastly, we need the problem itself.  We need to know
	exactly what you did to get the problem.  We need to know if
	the problem is consistent or intermittent.  We need to know if
	the program output anything prior to the problem.  We need to
	know exactly what happens when you run into the problem.  If
	you want to get ambitious, try some of the diagnostic tools I
	discuss below, such as a backtrace, and include the
	information in the mail.</P
><P
>Now before you are ready to post, you need to come up
	with a good subject line.  Gnome-list can have a lot of
	messages on it, you want yours to stand out to the people you
	need help from, and be safely passed over by people who can't
	help.  A subject of "GNOME is broken" is likely to get passed
	over; one of "GSM sucks" will get people in an angry mood, not
	a helpful one; something like "Most panel icons on HP-UX are
	just black squares" is likely to get the right sort of
	attention.</P
><P
>Put this all together into one long email and post it
	onto the list.  If you followed my advice, you are more likely
	to get a quick, thoughtful response. If for some reason you
	don't get a quick response, don't take it personally, the mail
	probably just got lost in the volume.  Wait a couple of days,
	see if there is any detail you can add, or perhaps a more
	descriptive header, and post it again.</P

></H2
><P
>If you find a bug, we want to know about it, we want to
	track it, and we want to fix it.  To make this process as
	efficient as possible, we borrowed Debian's excellent bug
	tracking system.  Full instructions on how to use it can be
	found at <A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org/Reporting.html"
TARGET="_top"
>	http://bugs.gnome.org/Reporting.html</A
>.</P
><P
>There are a few things to keep in mind in sending bugs
	to the system.  First make sure to check the web front end at
	<A
HREF="http://bugs.gnome.org"
TARGET="_top"
>http://bugs.gnome.org</A
> to make sure
	that your bug isn't yet known to the system.  If it is a new
	bug, send it to <A
HREF="submit@bugs.gnome.org"
TARGET="_top"
>submit@bugs.gnome.org</A
>.
	Make sure you include the Package and Version headings as
	described in the instructions, this will make sure it gets
	routed quickly and automatically to the right people.  Make
	sure you include full details.  See the previous question for
	some suggestions on what is useful to include.  If a backtrace
	or strace is appropriate, by all means include it.
	Instructions on how to do this is given below.</P
><P
>After you submit the bug to the system.  You will get
	feedback on the bug via email.  You also can track the status
	of the bug through the bug tracking system's web front
	end.</P

></H2
><P
>When GNOME is compiled, you need to specify where it is
	located in the filesystem.  The option used to specify this is
	called <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--prefix</TT
>, so we call it the GNOME
	Prefix, or prefix for short.  GNOME's file locations should be
	the same from system to system, except for the prefix, so a
	file in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/usr/share/gnome/pixmaps</TT
> on one
	system may be in
	<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/opt/gnome/share/gnome/pixmaps</TT

	<TT

	Fault</TT

></H2
><P
>Most Unix and Unix like systems have a feature called
	memory protection.  What this means is the program is allowed
	to access some parts of memory (often called segments), but
	not others.  If the program tries to access memory outside of
	the segments it is permitted to access, the system detects the
	problem and signals an error.  This error is called a
	Segmentation Fault (abbreviated <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"segv"</SPAN
> on some
	systems), and generally, the program will end suddenly, often
	leaving behind a core dump (see below).</P
><P
>What it all boils down to is there is a bug in whatever
	program you were running.  The bug might be in the GNOME
	source code, it might be in the shared libraries your program
	uses, or it might be in the way the program was compiled.  If
	you are unsure whether it is a bug in GNOME or somewhere else,
	ask about it on the list.  If you are sure the bug lies within
	GNOME, please make sure it's on the bug tracking
	system.</P

NAME="CORE"
>What is a core dump?  What is this file named core that
	I keep running into?</A
></H2
><P
>In the early days of electronic computers, computer
	memory was a bunch of magnetic rings called cores, mounted on
	wires.  This type of memory was called core memory.  When a
	programmer wanted to see what was going on in their program,
	they would output a copy of what was in their core memory so
	they could analyze it.  This output was called a core dump,
	and the term has remained long after core memory became
	obsolete.</P
><P
>In many Unix and Unix-like systems, the system will
	automatically produce a core dump when a program fails
	catastrophically, for example when it has a Segmentation Fault
	(see above).  It generally puts the core dump into a file
	named <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>core</TT
> in the directory you were in
	when you ran the program.  This file is very useful for
	debugging why the program failed, and can be used to produce a
	backtrace (see below).  On the other hand, this file can be
	quite large, particularly if you aren't using it for
	debugging.  If you can't afford to have core dumps, consult
	your system documentation to find out how to disable this
	feature.</P

NAME="BACKTRACE"
>What is a backtrace?  Someone just asked me to send
	them a backtrace, how do I do this?</A
></H2
><P
>An incredibly useful debugging tool is the backtrace.
	This is essentially a snapshot of exactly where in the program
	you are.  It is most often done when a program crashes (exits
	unexpectedly, often with a segmentation fault or other error)
	or hangs (stops working but doesn't exit).  In this answer,
	I'm going to have to assume you are using the GNU project's
	GDB debugger, since that's the most common one used with
	GNOME, and the one I've used.  If you use some other debugger,
	consult your documentation.</P
><P
>There are two ways to do a backtrace.  You can use a
	core file left when the program crashed, or you can run the
	program from within the debugger.  I have found that running
	the program within the debugger is more reliable, but I will
	discuss using core files as well.</P
><P
>To run a program within GDB, go to an xterm (or
	equivalent), and type <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>gdb &#60;full name and
	location of program&#62;</B
></TT
>, for example, to debug
	gtalk, you might do <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>gdb
	/usr/local/bin/gtalk</B
></TT
>.  GDB does not search the
	path, so you have to specify where the program is.  If you
	want to run the program with arguments, <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>don't put
	them here</I
>.  You can specify command like arguments
	later.</P
><P
>GDB will then identify itself, and give you a
	<TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>(gdb)</TT
> prompt.  From here, you type
	<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>run</B
></TT
> to start the program.  If you want
	to run the program with arguments, put them here.  For
	example, to debug gtalk with sound disabled, you would type
	<TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>run --disable-sound</B
></TT
>.  The program will
	then start.  Keep in mind the program will be slower than
	normal, and it will use a lot more memory.</P
><P
>Now you try to recreate the problem you had.  Do
	whatever it is that caused the problem before.  Once the
	program crashes, you should immediately see stuff in the debug
	session, and a <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>(gdb)</TT
> prompt.  If the program
	hangs, wait until you are sure it is hung in the right place,
	and then hit Control-C in the debug session.  It too should
	reply with a bunch of stuff, followed by a
	<TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>(gdb)</TT
> prompt.  At this prompt (whichever way
	you got to it), type <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>bt</B
></TT
>.  It will then
	reply with the actual backtrace.</P
><P
>Here's an example of a debug session.  If you are asked
	for a backtrace, you should send in the whole
	thing:</P
