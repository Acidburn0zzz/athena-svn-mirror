Problems with known workarounds:
- Compiling on NEXTSTEP: create an 'uname' command that simply says 'NEXTSTEP'.
- Digital Unix 4.0e: the system compiler compiles web2c wrongly when
  optimization is used. tex, mf, mpost cannot read their pool files.
  Fix: use gcc or compile with -O0.
- core dump of mf and mp on HP-UX with -O2 + gcc 2.8.1.
  Recompiling mf1.c and mp1.c with -O seems to cure the problems.
- xdvi, mfw don't find the shared X libraries on some systems. Fix: relink
  with LD_RUN_PATH (environment variable) or -rpath commandline option.
- GNU make 3.77 on Solaris 2.6 (and later) is broken. Fix: recompile
  GNU make with
    rm -f glob/*.o
    make CFLAGS='-O -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'
- some versions of the egcs compiler (e.g. 1.1) are known to produce
  broken binaries for TeX (the error shows during texconfig init with a
  message about a missing control sequence \inaccessible). Fix: recompile
  teTeX with CFLAGS='-O2 -fno-force-mem'. Better update your egcs compiler
  to egcs-1.1.2 or newer.
- egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release) fails to compile
  xdvik/special.c Fix: compile that file with "-O2 -fno-inline". Better
  update your egcs compiler to egcs-1.1.2 or newer.
- --enable-shared does not work on all systems. This will be improved by
  the next version of web2c. Until then, work around any problems if
  you know how or don't use --enable-shared.
- gcc 2.7.2.1 on MacOS X hangs on compiling texk/web2c/mft.c. Compiling
  that file without -O2 works.
- MacOS X does not have and libm library. Just remove -lm in
  texk/make/programs.mk (until we find a way to do this automatically)

Problems which don't cause malfunctions:
- dvipsk shows Broken Pipe messages when \includegraphics is used for
  large gzip'ped graphic files. (The ruesult is ok, though.)
