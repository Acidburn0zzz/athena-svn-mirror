This file lists known problems (and possible known work-arounds) of
teTeX-2.0. Report bugs to tetex@dbs.uni-hannover.de.

Problems with known workarounds:
- Solaris 8/9 with gcc-3.2 and gcc-3.2.1: "gftopk: fatal: putbyte(255)
  failed." Solution: recompile gftopk without optimization, e.g.
    (cd texk/web2c; rm -f gftopk.o; make gftopk CFLAGS=)
  Using the SUN compilers is another possible way around this bug.
