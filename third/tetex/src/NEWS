  News in release 2.0:
===========================================================================

- included files reviewed for license problems; teTeX now is free software!
- added programs: dvipdfm, texdoctk
- updated programs: web2c 7.4.5, xdvik 22.40v, dvipsk 5.92a, texinfo 4.4,
  pdftex 1.10a, Omega 1.23.2, gsftopk 3.4.5
- pazo and tx/px fonts added (to supplement times / palatino)
- many other fonts / macro packages updated or added (too many to
  list here)

  dvips now uses outline fonts by default, so its output is less
  resolution dependend and ready for conversion into pdf. Secure mode
  is now on by default in dvips and the program no longer searches the
  current directory for config files (for security reasons). Many bugs
  in the font subsetting codes have been fixed, so dvips now works fine
  with cm-super fonts (not part of teTeX).

  TeX and xdvi now support sources specials and this helps the previewer
  to interact with your editor and vice versa.

  Note that some default settings of "tex, the Web2C implementation of
  TeX" have changed.  We determined that some extensions were in fact
  in conflict with the strict definition of TeX as laid down by Knuth.

  The most notable change is that parsing of '%&' constructs in the
  first line of an input file is now disabled by default -- it can
  be enabled in texmf.cnf if you desire this.  In that case, tex will
  announce itself as TeXk and print an additional banner line saying
  that %&-line parsing is enabled.

  The xdvi previewer now can now render outline fonts directly. So,
  font bitmaps are hardly needed anymore.

  News in release 1.0:
===========================================================================
- updated programs: web2c 7.3.1, xdvik 22.05-k, dvips(k) 5.86, dviljk 2.6p2,
  texinfo 3.12. xdvik and dvipsk are now hypertex aware. The new
  kpathsea library allows to have a ls-R file in each texmf tree. TeX
  and friends now support true 8bit reading/writing by means of the
  TCX extension.  Some arrays which had a fixed size in TeX+friends now
  increase dynamically, others can read their size from a config file
  (which means that they can be enlarged without recompilation).
- added programs: pdftex 0.13d, e-TeX 2.1, Omega 1.8
- ConTeXt added
- Postscript type 1 font versions: Computer Modern, AMS fonts, 35 base
  laserwriter fonts, Polish and Cyrillic variants of CM and others
- much improved index file for the documentation tree (newhelpindex.html)
- metrics for Y&Y's commercial mathtime and lucida bright fonts are
  included, which greatly simplifies using these fonts

This release is now called 1.0, because all extensions of previous
versions (e.g. make TeX use ls-R etc.) have become official part of the
web2c and kpathsea distribution and no longer require special patches.
Additionally, temporary hacks which required GNU utils (GNU make, gcc,
flex) could be removed and replaced by portable solutions.

This release has many advantages for perparing documents for the web,
due to improved/added programs. pdf files with hyperlinks and thumbnails
can be created either by using dvips+distiller or more directly by
using pdftex. Postscript with resolution-independant fonts can be
generated due to the included postscript type 1 fonts.
