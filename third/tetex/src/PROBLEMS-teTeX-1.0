This file lists known problems (and possible work-arounds) of teTeX-1.0.

Report bugs to tetex@dbs.uni-hannover.de

Problems with known workarounds:
- Compiling on NEXTSTEP: create an 'uname' command that simply says 'NEXTSTEP'.
- Digital Unix 4.0e: the system compiler compiles web2c wrongly when
  optimization is used. tex, mf, mpost cannot read their pool files.
  Fix: use gcc or compile with -O0.
- core dump of mf and mp on HP-UX with -O2 + gcc 2.8.1.
  Recompiling mf1.c and mp1.c with -O seems to cure the problems.
- xdvi, mfw don't find the shared X libraries on some systems. Fix: relink
  with LD_RUN_PATH (environment variable) or -rpath commandline option.
- GNU make 3.77 on Solaris 2.6 (and later) is broken. Fix: recompile
  GNU make with
    cd glob; rm -f *.o
    make CFLAGS='-O -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64'
    cd ..; make
- some versions of the egcs compiler (e.g. 1.1) are known to produce
  broken binaries for TeX (the error shows during texconfig init with a
  message about a missing control sequence \inaccessible). Fix: recompile
  teTeX with CFLAGS='-O2 -fno-force-mem'. Better update your egcs compiler
  to egcs-1.1.2 or newer.
- egcs-2.91.60 19981201 (egcs-1.1.1 release) fails to compile
  xdvik/special.c Fix: compile that file with "-O2 -fno-inline". Better
  update your egcs compiler to egcs-1.1.2 or newer.
  It also miscompiles odvips on AIX 4.2.1.
- gcc-2.95 and gcc-2.95.1 are known to reproduce wrong code on some
  platforms (e.g. sparc). If you have to use one of the above mentioned
  gcc versions, don't use -O2 optimization.  -O should be ok. gcc-2.95.2
  seems to work ok with -O2.
- On Sparc/Solaris, SUN's WorkShop Compilers 5.0 98/12/15 C 5.0
  miscompiles tex if the optimization flag `-fast' is used. `-O' flag is
  apparently ok. Symptom: checksums in the pool files are not composed
  of the characters "0" through "9".
- --enable-shared does not work on all systems. This will be improved by
  the next version of web2c. Until then, work around any problems if
  you know how or don't use --enable-shared.
- gcc 2.7.2.1 on MacOS X hangs on compiling texk/web2c/mft.c. Compiling
  that file without -O2 works.
- There is a bug in HP's libc (some versions of HPUX 10.20). Symptom:
  basically, xdvi would wait forever for ghostscript.  The bug can
  be fixed with a patch: PHCO_19181, which can be gotten from the HP
  electronic support center, http://us-support.external.hp.com/.
- If you are using a BSD 4.4 or 4.5 system such as FreeBSD or NetBSD,
  you may have to use GNU make (often installed in `/usr/local/bin'),
  not the BSD make.

Problems which don't cause malfunctions:
- dvipsk shows Broken Pipe messages when \includegraphics is used for
  large gzip'ped graphic files (the result is ok, though)
