This directory contains some supporting data files for fontname
translation. It also contains the TCX tables.  See the Web2c and
Kpathsea manuals.

Subject: New tcx files

Thanks to suggestions fom CSTUG and GUST members I prepared the new
versions of tcx tables. Below is draft of translate-file naming scheme:

1. The tcx filenames are at most 8 characters long.  (There will be
   djgpp DOS distribution based on web2c and hopefully, E. Mattes will
   also change accordingly emTeX some day ;-)
2. The leading 6 (at most) characters describe input encoding,
   the trailing 2 characters describe font encoding. Both parts
   of the name can be separated by a dash.
3. Two-letters font encoding description should be used for common
   fonts encodings (like t1). Since CS and PL are used localy,
   but widely in the respective coutries, these (and similar)
   suffixes would be allowed for describing font encoding.
4. Conforming fully to LaTeX's inputenc/fontenc conventions turned out
   impossible and would be hardly accepted and understood by the users
   of other formats.
