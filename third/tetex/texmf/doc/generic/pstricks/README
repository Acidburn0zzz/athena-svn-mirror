			| PSTricks 97 documentation |
                        -----------------------------

  These files are the up to date and "supported" documentation for the current
PSTricks 97 distribution.

  Up to now, there is only the original documentation for the `multido'
package (still up to date), the documentation for the `pst-fill' package
written by Denis Girou and the `pstricks.bug' file, which list the known
bugs in current distribution, with workarounds when some are known.

  The _reference_ documentation is not up to date and is still the one of the
old 0.93a distribution. You still _must_ refer to it, but it is in the
obsolete/doc directory to specify clearly that it is not up to date.

  It also contain the "supported" test file test-pst.tex for the distribution,
which allow to test all the various parts of the distribution (excluding the
`pst-fill' package). It is the unification in a single file of most of the
examples of the PSTricks chapter of "The LaTeX Graphics Companion".
It require the `calc', `graphicx' and `ifthen' package from the LaTeX
distribution, `subfigure' from CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/supported/subfigure,
`multido' and all PSTricks packages, `pst-poly' from pstricks/contrib/pst-poly
and `random' from CTAN/macros/generic. You may have some warning messages
concerning fonts missing.
  And, as it is a rather extensive file which test and demonstrate a lot of
PSTricks functionnalities, it is rather huge. In our days, it is not a problem
on the majority of platforms and TeX implementations, but it can be on some.
Here are the TeX ressources required:

  3890 strings
 40592 string characters
178853 words of memory 
  6073 multiletter control sequences
 17049 words of font info for 54 fonts
    18 hyphenation exceptions
30i,20n,53p,269b,798s stack positions

  Take care also that on some non Unix systems, you may have to replace
the / character by, for instance, the : one in the file test-pst.tex:
\input{lgc:#2.inl}}
