  These files are the original documentation of the version 0.93a of PSTricks.
They are provided "as it", because there are still the _reference_
documentation for PSTricks.

  But take care that:
      - this documentation is not strictly up to date,
      - the betadoc?.ps files show some changes made in macros described
in the pst-usr?.ps ones,
      - the file pst-doc.err list the known errors in the files of this
directory,
      - there is no documentation for the `pst-3d' package,
      - the documentation for the `pst-fill' package is in the doc directory,
      - you can take advantage to look at the PSTricks chapter of
"The LaTeX Graphics Companion", by Michel Goossens, Sebastian Rahtz and
Frank Mittelbach, Addison Wesley, 1997
