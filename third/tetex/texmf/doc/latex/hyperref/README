INTRODUCTION
============

This package is used to emend cross-referencing commands in LaTeX to
produce some sort of \special commands; there are backends for the
\special set defined for HyperTeX dvi processors, for embedded pdfmark
commands for processing by Acrobat Distiller (dvips and dvipsone), for
dviwindo, for pdfTeX, for TeX4ht, and for VTEX's pdf and HTML
backends.

Included are:

  a) `backref' a package by David Carlisle to provide links back from
     bibliography to the main text; these are hypertext links after using
     hyperref.
  b)  `nameref' a package to allow reference to the *names* of sections rather
     than their numbers.

DOWNLOAD
========

`hyperref' is available on CTAN:
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/

`CTAN:' means one of the `Comprehensive TeX Archive Network'
nodes or one of its mirrors.  This is explained in
  http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=archives

The files are organized in three, sometimes four directories:
  ./
    Root directory that contains `README', `.dtx',
    and `.ins' files.
  doc/
    Directory for documentation files.
  test/
    Directory for some test files.
  beta/
    Sometimes this directory exists and contains
    the latest beta/test versions of some files,
    often `hyperref.dtx'.

The main repository of hyperref is located at the server
of the international `TeX User Group' (TUG). The hyperref
directory at the TUG server
  http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/
contains the following files:
  hyperref.zip
  hyperref-doc.zip
  hyperref-test.zip
  hyperref-beta.zip
    The files of the four directories, described above, are
    packed into four ZIP archives, so that they can be easily
    downloaded. (The ZIP files do not contain directories.)

  manual.html
  manual2.html
  manual.css
    HTML version of the quite old hyperref manual in `doc/manual.pdf'.

The CTAN stuff will be mirrored automatically from the
ftp server, so
  ftp://ftp.tug.org/pub/tex/hyperref/
corresponds to
  CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/

INSTALLATION
============

a) Download the hyperref files from CTAN or the TUG server.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Replace the files by the counterparts in the beta directory,
   if you want to use the latest versions.
c) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex hyperref.ins
d) Install the files `*.sty', `*.def', and `*.cfg' in your TDS tree:
     cp *.sty *.def *.cfg .../texmf/tex/latex/hyperref/
   Replace `...' by the prefix of your TDS tree.
e) Update the databases if necessary, eg. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf

ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
===================

Depending on the driver, hyperref loads other packages:
* url.sty
    CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/url.sty
* keyval.sty, color.sty:
    CTAN:macros/latex/required/graphics/
  An uptodate pdftex.def is available at
    http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/pdftex.def
    CTAN:macros/pdftex/graphics/pdftex.def

NEW FEATURES
============

* Default driver setting (hyperref >= 6.72s).
  If no driver is given, hyperref tries its best to guess the
  most suitable driver. Thus it loads "hpdftex", if pdfTeX is
  detected running in PDF mode. Or it loads the corresponding
  VTeX driver for VTeX's working modes.
    Unhappily many driver programs run after the TeX compiler,
  so hyperref does not have a chance (dvips, dvipdfm, ...).
  In this case driver "hypertex" is loaded that supports the
  HyperTeX features that are recognized by xdvi for example.
  This behaviour, however, can easily changed in the configuration
  file "hyperref.cfg":
    \providecommand*{\Hy@defaultdriver}{hdvips}
  for dvips, or
    \providecommand*{\Hy@defaultdriver}{hypertex}
  for the default behaviour of hyperref.

PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=====================

Currently only package loading orders are available:

algorithm:
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage[chapter]{algorithm}% eg.

cite:
  This is from Mike Shell:
> cite.sty cannot currently be used with hyperref.
> However, I can do a workaround via:
>
> \makeatletter
> \def\NAT@parse{\typeout{This is a fake Natbib command to fool Hyperref.}}
> \makeatother
>
> \usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
>
> so that hyperref will not redefine any of the biblabel stuff - so cite.sty
> will work as normal - although the citations will not be hyperlinked, of
> course (But this may not be an issue for many people).

BUGREPORTS
==========

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
  * \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the TeX code
    to get more informations in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
  * If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles" to get
    a list of version informations at the end of the
    LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom necessary,
  so send them only on request.
