Showlabels: put the names of \labels into the margins of a draft document
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.2

This class option introduces no new commands, it just helps you keep
track of all the labels by putting the name of the new label into the
margin whenever either the |\label| command is used, or an equation is
automatically numbered (by replacing the internal |\@eqnnum| command).
There are therefore no usage instructions.  You invoke this package
with the command |\usepackage{showlabels}| in the preamble, and you
may give the options \Lopt{inner} or \Lopt{outer} (the default) to
have the labels placed in the inner or outer margin of the text.

The package will also work in the presence of the \Lopt{twocolumn}
option.  In this case, the options \Lopt{inner} and \Lopt{outer} will
be ignored, and the label will be placed in the nearer margin.

The package has (finally) been modified to deal with the slightly
different mechanism that AMS-\LaTeX\ uses to produce equation numbers.
I don't habitually use AMS-\LaTeX, so I won't discover any bugs or
weaknesses with its support here, and I'd consequently be glad to be
informed of any that appear.  The |\usepackage{showlabels}| must
appear \emph{after} any AMS stuff is loaded.

For reasonably obvious reasons, this package will \emph{not} work at
all well with the \pstyle{multicol} package, and for possibly less
obvious reasons, it won't work with the \Lopt{leqno} option either (at
some point it should be modified to at least recognise and warn of the
conflict in either case).
