Installation
============

Preamble:
---------

This manual is only for use with TeX installations using TDS. Examples
of those TeX installations are teTeX and MikTeX. If you are not sure,
search about a directory named `texmf'. Perhaps there are more lots of
directories named `texmf'. At unix you may find `/usr/texmf' (or
`/usr/share/texmf' or `/usr/TeX/texmf' or `/usr/share/TeX/texmf'),
`/usr/local/texmf' (or `/usr/local/share/texmf' or 
`/usr/TeX/texmf.local' or many more) and several users with 
`~/texmf' (`texmf' at the home directory of several users). At windows
with MikTeX this is often `\texmf' or `\Miktex' and `\localtexmf'.

One of these is the primary texmf tree of the package manager
(`/usr/texmf' or `/usr/share/texmf' or ..., with MikTeX `\texmf' or 
`\Miktex'). This was created at the installation of your TeX 
distribution.

One of these is the system texmf tree (`/usr/local/texmf' or
`/usr/local/share/texmf' or ..., with MikTeX `\localtexmf'). If you 
are administrator use this texmf tree to install KOMA-Script.

If you install KOMA-Script as normal user, you have to ask your
administrator, where to install KOMA-Script. You can also ask
texmf.cfg, if you can use a local texmf tree at your HOME directory.

Short:

- Do NOT install KOMA-Script at the primary texmf tree of the package
  manager (e.g. if you're using MikTeX not at `\texmf' oder `\Miktex').
- If you are administrator, install KOMA-Script at the system texmf
  tree.
- If you are normal user, use the texmf tree of your HOME directory or
  "Own Files" at windows or ask your administrator.

In the following `.../texmf' is used for your texmf tree. If you are
using windows and the explorer or DOS-prompt, you have also replace
every slash (`/') by backslash (`\'). At TeX itself you're using still
slash for directory separation.


Installation:
-------------

At Unix you may edit a `Makefile' called copy of `Makefile.unx', set
variable INSTALLTEXMF to your texmf tree, save Makefile and call make. 
If no error occurs, you can do the installation with `make install'
subsequently.

If you don't use Unix or don't like Makefile, do this:

1. Copy all files of KOMA-Script bundle to a new directory and change
   to this directory.
2. Call LaTeX with filename komascr.ins. At Unix just say:
       latex komascr.ins
   This may be done at windows, too.
   If LaTeX tells you some files already existing, DO NOT overwrite
   them, yet.
   Inform yourself, which files are newer, the one you want to install
   or the already installed. Afterwards call LaTeX again an overwrite
   older files - and only older - by newer.
3. Copy all generated files ending `.cls' and all files ending `.sty' 
   and all files ending `.lco' into the directory 
   `.../texmf/tex/latex/koma-script'. If there isn't a directory named
   `.../texmf/tex/latex/koma-script', create it. (Remember! This is
   `\localtexmf\tex\latex\koma-script' at MikTeX.)
4. Copy all files ending `.dvi', `.ps', `.pdf', `.txt' or `.TXT' and all
   `komabug.tex' and `scrclass.dtx' into the directory
   `.../texmf/doc/latex/koma-script'. If there isn't a directory named
   `.../texmf/doc/latex/koma-script', create it. (Remember! This is
   `\localtexmf\doc\latex\koma-script' at MikTeX.) Copy `scrclass.dtx'
   to this directory, too. This will be need, if you'll want to 
   generate a bug report.
   You will need file `scrclass.dtx' there, if you try to write a bug 
   report. You may use a symbolic link to the file at the source
   directory instead of a copy of `scrclass.dtx'.
5. Install adrconv package. This step is only neccessary, if you got
   it separatly from KOMA-Script or have one at subdirectory `contrib'
   at your KOMA-Script distribution.
6. Maybe you have to inform your TeX distribution about the newly
   installed files. Using teTeX you have to call `texhash', using 
   MikTeX this is `Refresh Filename Database'. At fpTeX there is also
   an entry at windows start button. Ask the manual of your
   distribution or your administrator.  
7. Save following als `komaexam.tex' and call LaTeX.
	  \documentclass{scrartcl}
	  \begin{document}
	  dummy
	  \end{document}
   Read the LOG file and search for the date and version numbers of
   the loaded scrlartcl class and typearea package. Compare these with
   the date and version number of the previously installed files
   scrartcl.cls and typearea.sty. If they are not equal, installation
   failed. Compare also the filenames at the LOG file. Ask your
   administrator for help.
8. Read all DVI files, you've copied at step 4. You should print at
   least scrguide. If you don't know l2short and usrguide, read them
   also before reading scrguide.

Have a nice day, even if you don't understand my 
`something-like-english'!
