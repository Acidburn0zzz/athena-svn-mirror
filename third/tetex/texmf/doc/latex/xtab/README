    The xtab package automatically breaks long tables so that they can
span multiple pages. It is an extension of the supertabular package,
providing additional functionality and reducing some of the weaknesses.

    The distribution consists of the following files:
README (this file)
xtab.ins
xtab.dtx

    To install the package:
o run: latex xtab.ins (which will generate xtab.sty)
o run: latex xtab.dtx
o run: makeindex -s gind.ist xtab
o run: latex xtab.dtx
o Print xtab.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 
o Move xtab.sty to a location where LaTeX will find it.
