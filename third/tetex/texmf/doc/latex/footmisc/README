This package replaces my earlier footnote package; it had to be
renamed as a result of a name clash with a package whose author did
not want his package's name changed.

(Users of my older package should note that this version no longer
depends on patch.tex, which itself is no longer supported due to the
withdrawal of the docstrip facilities on which it used to rely.)

Though it is supported, my package is only tested under LaTeX of
1995/12/01 and later; please don't bother reporting bugs that appear
under earlier versions of LaTeX.
