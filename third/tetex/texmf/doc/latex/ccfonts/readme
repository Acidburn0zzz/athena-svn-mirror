What's new?
===========

Version 0.992 supports the [slantedGreek] option.



Overview
========

This distribution contains a LaTeX package and the necessary
fd files to use the Concrete fonts with LaTeX.  The
distributed files are:

ccfonts.ins     installation script
oinst.ins       ditto, for LaTeX < dec. 1996
cc.fdd          documented source of the fd files
ccfonts.dtx     documented source of the LaTeX package
readme          the file you are reading now
liesmich        the german version of this file 



* WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING *** WARNING **
============================================================

LaTeX2e (< 6/1997) came with an installation script named
`cmextra.ins' which generated *obsolete* fd files for the
Concrete fonts.  If you have run this script upon
installation of your LaTeX system, and if you have requested
support for the Concrete fonts, you MUST now remove the
following files from your computer:

OT1ccr.fd  resp.  ot1ccr.fd
T1ccr.fd   resp.  t1ccr.fd

Within a TDS-compliant file system these files should be
found in the directory texmf\tex\latex\base.  They may also
exist as a part of a pre-installed LaTeX anywhere in your
TeX file system.



Installing the files
====================

Copy the files

cc.fdd
ccfonts.dtx
ccfonts.ins

to a temporary directory or to a directory where you keep
documented LaTeX source files.  

In case your LaTeX is from Dec.  1996 or newer, run the
installation script ccfonts.ins through LaTeX to generate
the font definition files and the LaTeX package.  With an
older LaTeX use oinst.ins instead.

The following files are created:

ccfonts.sty: The LaTeX package for using the Concrete fonts.

omlccr.fd, omlxcm.fd, omsccr.fd, omsxcsy.fd, omxxcex.fd,
ot1ccr.fd, t1ccr.fd, ts1ccr.fd:  The font definition files 
for the Concrete fomts.

These files must be moved to a directory where LaTeX
searches for style files.

The latter step is not required if your "docstrip" tool has
been configured to write directly to the TeX directories,
and if the directory tex/latex/ccfonts exists in your TDS
tree before running ccfonts.ins.

Finally, run the file ccfonts.dtx through LaTeX to generate
the documentation of the LaTeX package ccfonts.sty.  You may
also generate cc.dvi from cc.fdd; this is a description of 
the low-level interface to the Concrete fonts.



Which fonts do I need?
======================

To make use of the ccfonts successfully, you need

1) the Concrete Fonts, from             fonts/concrete
2) the Concrete Math Fonts, from        fonts/concmath
3) the EC Concrete Fonts, from          fonts/ecc

The directory names given above are for the CTAN.



Which text font series/shapes are supported?
============================================

family  series  shape(s)        (see below)

ccr     m       n, sl, it, sc 
ccr     c       sl              (1)

(1) This font shape is (at the moment) only available with
OT1, i.e. the traditional font encoding.

For each font given above (except ccr/c/sl), a corresponding
text companion font is available and supported.

There is no boldface font series in the Concrete fonts. 
Two possible substitutions are provided in the fd files:

requested font series   substitution      (see below)

bx                      CM Roman bx           (1)
sbc                     CM Sans Serif sbc     (2)

(1) This is the *default* behaviour.

(2) Say \renewcommand{\bfdefault}{sbc} to get this
substitution with the usual commands \textbf and \bfseries.
CM Sans sbc (e.g.  in headings) blends well with Concrete!
This was the default behaviour with ccfonts.sty v0.9.



Compatibility with concmath.sty
===============================
In case you install both the ccfonts package and U. Vieth's
'concmath' collection (v2.0 or above),  the file ot1ccr.fd
will exist twice on your system.   Both files contain the
same information, so this should not cause any problems.



Thanks to ...
=============

...  Frank Jensen for the permit to copy some ideas from
his package beton.sty.



Terms of distribution
=====================

Redistribution of this collection of files is allowed,
provided that it is complete and unchanged.  You are,
however, NOT ALLOWED to take money for the distribution or
use of these files or the fonts generated from them, except
for a nominal charge for copying etc.

The distribution of changed versions of the files is allowed
under the following restrictions:

- You rename the file(s) before you make any changes.
- You distribute the unchanged version with your file(s).
- You acknowledge the origin of the unchanged version in the
  file(s).
- You make sure that the changed versions contain a notice
  that prevents others to take money for distribution or use
  of your file(s), i.e. they have to be distributed under
  the above restrictions.
