This macro package serves for using the MathTimeProfessional
fonts, which are available from Y&Y, Inc <admin@yandy.com>.
Development of the package was commissioned by Y&Y, Inc.

See 
    <http://www.yandy.com/download/mtpguide.pd> 
    
for a detailed discussion of these fonts; a font sample can
be downloaded as

    <http://www.yandy.com/download/mtpsample.pdf> .
    
The MathTimeProfessional fonts include also a licensed copy
of the corresponding text fonts `Times New Roman' from
Monotype.

The .tfm files of the MathTimeProf fonts, as well as the
.fd, .tfm and .vf files of Times New Roman, are distributed
in conjunction with the fonts and are to be installed
according to the accompanying instructions.


Installing the macro package
============================

The documented source of the package is the file mtpro.dtx,
which is accompanied by the installation script mtpro.ins.

To generate the package file you should run:

        latex mtpro.ins

This will generate the following files:

        mtpro.sty
        mpy1mtt.fd
        mpy2mtt.fd
        mpy3mtt.fd
        umtt.fd 
        omslby.fd
        umtms.fd 

These files must then be moved to a directory where LaTeX
will find them. 

The files omslby.fd and umtms.fd may already be present on 
your TeX system, if you have installed Frank Mittelbach's 
mathtime bundle; you need not install them twice.


Documentation
=============

Documentation on the package is available as a ready-made
PDF file mtpro.pdf (for one-sided printing on letter size
paper).

You may also typeset the documentation yourself by running
LaTeX on the DTX file:

        latex mtpro.dtx

Note that this requires the Times NRMT and MathTimePro
fonts, as well as the macro packages generated above!
