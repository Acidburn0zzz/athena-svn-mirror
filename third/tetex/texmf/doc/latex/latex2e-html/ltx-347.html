 <tt>\vspace[*]{length}</tt>
<p>

 The <tt>\vspace</tt> command adds vertical  space.  The length of the space can
 be expressed  in any  terms  that  LaTeX  understands,  i.e.,  points,
 inches, etc.  You can add negative  as well as positive  space with an
 <tt>\vspace</tt> command.
<p>
 If <tt>\vspace</tt> appears in the middle of a paragraph the space
 is added after the line containing it.
<p>
 LaTeX removes vertical  space that comes at the end of a page.  If you
 don't  want  LaTeX  to remove  this  space,  include  the  optional  *
 argument.  Then the space is never removed.
