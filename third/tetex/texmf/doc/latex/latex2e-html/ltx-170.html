<p>
 A table of contents is produced with the 
 <a href="toc.html"><tt>\tableofcontents</tt></a> command. You
 put the command  right  where  you want the table  of contents  to go;
 LaTeX does the rest for you.  
 Entries are taken from the <a href="ltx-141.html">Sectioning</a> commands.
<p>
 <tt>\tableofcontents</tt> produces  a heading,  but it does not
 automatically  start  a new page.   If you want a new page  after  the
 table   of   contents,   include   a  
 <a href="ltx-276.html"><tt>\newpage</tt></a>   command   after   the
 <tt>\tableofcontents</tt> command.
<p>
 There  are  similar  commands  <tt>\listoffigures</tt>  and 
 <tt>\listoftables</tt>  for
 producing  a list  of figures  and  a list  of  tables,  respectively.
 Everything works exactly the same as for the table of contents.
<p>
 NOTE: Information for these tables and lists are placed in an auxiliary file
 and you may have to run latex twice to get it to come out correctly.  
 If you want any of these  items  to be generated,  you can not
 have the <tt>\nofiles</tt> command in your document as that would suppress
 writing of the auxiliary files.
