    The ccaption package provides commands for `continuation captions',
unnumbered captions, and a legend heading for any environment. 
Methods are also provided to define captions for use outside float 
(e.g., figure and table) environments, and to define new float environments
and subfloats. Tools are provided for defining your own captioning styles.

    It has been tested in conjunction with the rotating, caption2, subfigure, 
sidecap, endfloat, tocloft and hyperref packages.
