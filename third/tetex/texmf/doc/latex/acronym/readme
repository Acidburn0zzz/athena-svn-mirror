I'd like to announce the availability of 
my LaTeX2e acronym Package from CTAN.

When writing a paper on cellular mobile radio I started to used a lot
of acronyms. This can be very disturbing for the reader, as he might
not know all the used acronyms. To help the reader I kept a list of
all the acronyms at the end of my paper.

This package makes sure, that all acronyms used in the text are
spelled out in full at least once. And it provides an environment to
keep a list of acronyms. Somewhere in the document.

Version 1.2 (August 1996) features a new command: \acl to print the
expanded acronym with out even mentioning that there is an acronym for
this word.
