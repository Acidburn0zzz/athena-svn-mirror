I'd like to announce the availability of
my LaTeX2e acronym Package from CTAN.

When writing a paper on cellular mobile radio I started to used a lot
of acronyms. This can be very disturbing for the reader, as he might
not know all the used acronyms. To help the reader I kept a list of
all the acronyms at the end of my paper.

This package makes sure, that all acronyms used in the text are
spelled out in full at least once. And it provides an environment to
keep a list of acronyms. Somewhere in the document.

Version 1.2 (August 1996) features a new command: \acl to print the
expanded acronym with out even mentioning that there is an acronym for
this word.

Version 1.4 (February 2000): A formatted acronym string, which is allowed
to contain indices, for example, is now possible. For this purpose
the syntax of \acro and \acrodef now permits an optional argument:
  \acro{<acronym>}{<full name>}                 (without opt. arg.)
  \acro{<acronym>}[<short name>]{<full name>}   (with opt. arg.)
The user macros \ac, \acs, \acl, and \acf print now <short name>
instead of <acronym>, if available.

Version 1.5 (May 2000): Added support for english plural forms and the
footnote option.

David Sterratt <David.C.Sterratt@ed.ac.uk>

Version 1.6 (May 2000): Added the smaller option and the macros \acsfont, 
\acffont, and \acfsfont used to control the appearance of  \acs and \acf.
