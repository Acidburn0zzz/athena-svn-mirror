                            Lettrine bundle

This bundle contains a package that I maintain to typeset dropped
capitals in a LaTeXe document.

Run latex on lettrine.dtx to get the documentation (lettrine.dvi),
then on lettrine.ins to strip the comments and create lettrine.sty.

If you wish, you can customize lettrine.cfg according to your needs.

Have a look at the PDF file demo.pdf in the doc directory, to see 
how different layouts for dropped capitals can be achieved.
You can also play with the source file demo.tex.
