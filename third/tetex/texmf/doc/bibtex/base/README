The files acm.bst, siam.bst, and ieeetr.bst (and any other BibTeX file I
maintain) and their accompanying documentation (i.e. the files btxbst.doc,
btxdoc.bbl, btxdoc.bib, btxdoc.tex, btxdoc.xua, btxhak.tex and xampl.bib)
may be freely used and distributed, provided that if any file is changed,
it also be renamed.

This restriction helps ensure that identically named versions of the
these files are indeed identical.
