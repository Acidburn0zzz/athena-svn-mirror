Special thanks to:

Donald Ervin Knuth
	for TeX

Linus Torvalds
	for Linux

Karl Berry + Olaf Weber
	for their work on web2c, dvips, xdvi and dvilj versions using
	the kpathsea library.  Without such good searching routines,
	the texmf-tree could not have been both: well organised and
	efficiantly searched.

Keith Refson
	for maintaining the newhelpindex.html file

Dirk Hillbrecht
	for ideas, suggestions, beta-testing and writing documentation.
