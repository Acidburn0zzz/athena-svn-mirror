For those who do not know what teTeX is: teTeX is a complete TeX
distribution for UNIX compatible systems. My main aims when putting
things together have been:

	- create something simple to install, use and maintain
	- include as much useful documentation as possible
	- test as much as possible and try to avoid bugs
