<h1>The TeX Catalogue License Definitions</h1>

<p><emp><B>NOTE:</B> The descriptions below come from bits and pieces
I've found, so please let me know of inaccuracies. Links are provided
to more authorative information where possible. To be sure, always
check the license conditions of software that you download.</emp>

<p>Here we list common licenses used by TeX-related software as
recorded in <a
href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams/TeX/catalogue.html">The
TeX Catalogue</a> as maintained by <a
href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams">Graham Williams</a>.
In all cases, please check the software's license before using the
software. General information about categories of licenses is avaiable
from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">GNU</a>.
License information recorded in the Catalogue can only be regarded as
indicative.  While I try to ensure it is accurate, and maintain it
through input from authors, the sheer size of this task makes it
difficult to maintain a watching brief on all licenses.</emp>

<p>The license conditions are <B>not</B> designed to restrict what can
be submitted to CTAN. They are used to determine where the software
will be located on CTAN (under the normal hierarchy or in the nonfree
hierarchy with links from the normal hierarchy). In this way,
redistributors of TeX and family can be surer of the legal
situation. The simple criteria is that any software not satisfying the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a> will be recognised as <i>nonfree</i> software.

<p><b>Free software</b> satisfies the criteria contained in the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>.  This software can be freely used, modified
(hence source must be available), and distributed (e.g. on
distributions like TeXLive, teTeX, and MikTeX). It is generally
copyrighted to legally protect it.  Users are generally given an
explicit license to copy, distribute, and/or modify the
software. Authors of free software may invite users to make monetary
donations if they wish, but can not oblige them to do so, or else the
software becomes nonfree. Free software may rely on nonfree software
for extra functionality, but provides useful functionality without
that nonfree software. Further information on free software is
available from <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">GNU</a>.

<p>While one category would be sufficient (<b>dfsg</b>) we identify
the common subcategories that satisfy the DFSG (BSD style licenses
also satisfy the DFSG but are generally not encouraged):

<p><b>Nonfree software</b> has restrictions on it that prohibit its
free distribution. <em>Software in this category can not be included
in distributions except, in general, by special permission or by
payment of a fee.</em> This software does <b>not</b> satisfy the <a
