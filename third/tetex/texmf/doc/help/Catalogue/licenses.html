<h1>The TeX Catalogue License Definitions</h1>

<p><emp><B>NOTE:</B> The descriptions below come from bits and pieces
I've found, so please let me know of inaccuracies. Links are provided
to more authorative information where possible. To be sure, always
check the license conditions of software that you download.</emp>

<p>Here we list common licenses used by TeX-related software as
recorded in <a
href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams/TeX/catalogue.html">The
TeX Catalogue</a> as maintained by <a
href="http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams">Graham Williams</a>.
In all cases, please check the software's license before using the
software. General information about categories of licenses is avaiable
from <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html">GNU</a>.
License information recorded in the Catalogue can only be regarded as
indicative.  While I try to ensure it is accurate, and maintain it
through input from authors, the sheer size of this task makes it
difficult to maintain a watching brief on all licenses.</emp>

<p>The license conditions are <B>not</B> designed to restrict what can
be submitted to CTAN. Certainly, they are used to determine where the
software will be located on CTAN (under the normal hierarchy or in the
<I>nonfree</I> hierarchy with links from the normal hierarchy). In
this way, redistributors of TeX and family can be surer (if not
certain) of the legal situation. The simple criteria is that any
software not satisfying the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a> will be recognised as <i>nonfree</i> software.

<p><b>Free software</b> satisfies the criteria contained in the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a> which provides the basis of the <A
HREF="http://opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Free Software
Guidelines</A>.  This software can be freely used, modified (hence
source must be available), and distributed (e.g. on distributions like
TeXLive, teTeX, and MikTeX). It is generally copyrighted to legally
protect it.  Users are generally given an explicit license to copy,
distribute, and/or modify the software. Authors of free software may
invite users to make monetary donations if they wish, but can not
oblige them to do so, or else the software becomes nonfree. Free
software may rely on nonfree software for extra functionality, but
provides useful functionality without that nonfree software. Further
information on free software is available from <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">GNU</a>.

<p>While one category would be sufficient (<b>dfsg</b>) we identify
the common subcategories that satisfy the DFSG:

</table>

<p><b>Nonfree software</b> has restrictions on it that in some way
prohibit its free distribution. <em>Software in this category can not
be included in distributions except, in general, with specific
permission of the author or by payment of a fee.</em> Because this
software does <b>not</b> satisfy the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>, on CTAN it will be stored in the nonfree
hierarchy (except for nosource which remains in the primary hierarchy)
but will have links into the main hierarchy so that the casual user
will still find it.
