		  \TeX{}sis is a Plain \TeX{} macro package which provides
		  useful features for typesetting research papers and
		  related documents. For example, it includes support
		  specifically for: Automatic numbering of equations,
		  figures, tables and references; Simplified control of
		  type sizes, line spacing, footnotes, running headlines
		  and footlines, and tables of contents, figures and
		  tables; Specialized document formats for research papers,
		  preprints and ``e-prints,'' conference proceedings,
		  theses, books, referee reports, letters, and memoranda;
		  Simplified means of constructing an index for a book or
		  thesis; Easy to use double column formatting; Specialized
		  environments for lists, theorems and proofs, centered or
		  non-justified text, and listing computer code;
		  Specialized macros for easily constructing ruled tables.
		  TeXsis was originally developed for physicists, but
		  others may also find it useful. It is completely
		  compatible with Plain \TeX.},
