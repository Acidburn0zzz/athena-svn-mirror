      MonTeX provides Mongolian and Manju for the TeX/LaTeX
      community.

      Mongolian is a language spoken in North East Asia, namely
      Mongolia and the Inner Mongol Autonomous Region of China.
      Today, it is written in an extended Cyrillic alphabet in
      Mongolia whereas the Uighur writing continues to be in
      use in Inner Mongolia, though it is also, legally speaking,
      the official writing system of Mongolia.

      Manju is another language of North East Asia, belonging
      to the Tungusic branch of the Altaic languages. Though
      it is virtually not spoken anymore, it survives in
      written form as Manju was the native language of the
      rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644--1911) in China. Large
      quantities of documents of the Imperial Archives survive,
      as well as some of the finest dictionaries ever compiled
      in Asia, like the Pentaglot, a dictionary comprising
      Manju, Tibetan, Mongolian, Uighur and Chinese. MonTeX
      provides all necessary characters for writing standard
      Mongolian in Cyrillic and Classical (aka Traditional or 
      Uighur) writing, and Manju as well as transliterated
      Tibetan texts, for which purpose a number of additional
      characters was created.
      
      In MonTeX, both Mongolian and Manju are entered in romanized
      form. The retransliteration (from Latin input to Mongolian
      and Manju output) is completely realized in TeX/Metafont so
      that no external preprocessor is required.
      
      Please note that most of the enhanced functions on MonTeX
      require a working e-LaTeX environment. This is especially
      true when compiling documents with Mongolian or Manju as
      the main document language. It is recommended to choose
      pdfelatex as the resulting PDF files are truly portable.
      Vertical text generated by MonTeX is not supported in DVI.

      This version of MonTeX makes all former versions of MonTeX
      and ManjuTeX obsolete.
