<!-- The basic design of the DTD for the TeX Catalogue

Copyright (c) 1999 Graham J. Williams

The CATALOGUE has a MAINTAINER which records the email address of the
person maintaining the catalogue, a DATESTAMP to record when it was
last modified, and a LICENSE to indicate that it can not be taken by
someone else and copyrighted.  It is to be freely available under
terms similar to the intent of the FSF GPL. All three attributes must
be provided.

The CATALOGUE consists of a collection of zero or more ENTITYs.

An ENTITY has an ID that is used internally to identify the entity.
Could also serve as a sorting key, although ENTITY->ABOUT->NAME might
be the better one to sort on, since it can be any general name, as
typically what the package is know by (and is not restricted to be an
XML ID, which can not, for example, start with a numeral). The
DATESTAMP attribute records the last time the entry was updated and
the MODIFIER attribute is the email address of the person who updated
it.

An ENTITY consists of at least an ABOUT, but also possibly a
DESCRIPTION and information abuot DISTRIBUTIONs.

The ABOUT element records general information about the package,
including a mandatory CAPTION (at least it probably should be
mandatory, but is not presently).

The empty LICENSE element consists the TYPE attribute which indicates
the type of license under which the package is available.  In general,
UNKNOWN and OTHER licenses are specifically excluded from free
distributions. Please refer to CTAN:/help/Catalogue/licenses.html, 
or http://www.cmis.csiro.au/Graham.Williams/TeX/licenses.html, for 
details.

The other information records the authority of the license.
