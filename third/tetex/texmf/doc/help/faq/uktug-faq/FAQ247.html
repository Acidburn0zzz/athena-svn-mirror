<h3>Where are the <code>am</code> fonts?</h3>
<p>One <em>still</em> occasionally comes across a request for the <code>am</code>
series of fonts.  The initials stood for 'Almost [Computer] Modern',
and they were the predecessors of the Computer Modern fonts that we
all know and love (or hate)
.
There's not a lot one can do with these
fonts; they are (as their name implies) almost (but not quite) the
same as the <code>cm</code> series; if you're faced with a document that requests
them, all you can reasonably do is to edit the document.  The
appearance of DVI files that request them is sufficiently rare that
no-one has undertaken the mammoth task of creating a translation of
them by means of virtual fonts; however, most drivers let you have a
configuration file in which you can specify font substitutions. If you
specify that every <code>am</code> font should be replaced by its corresponding
<code>cm</code> font, the output should be almost correct.
