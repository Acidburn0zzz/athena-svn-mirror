<h3>Weird characters in <i>dvips</i> output</h3>
<!-- fi ligature pound pounds sterling elephants -->
<p>You've innocently generated output, using <i>dvips</i>, and there
are weird transpositions in it: for example, the <code>fi</code> ligature has
appeared as a &pound; symbol.  This is an unwanted side-effect of
the precautions
outlined in

<a href="FAQ76.html">generating PostScript for PDF</a>.
The <code>-G1</code> switch discussed in that question is appropriate for
Knuth's text fonts, but doesn't work with text fonts that don't follow
Knuth's patterns (such as fonts supplied by Adobe).
<p>If the problem arises, suppress the <code>-G1</code> switch: if you were using it
explicitly, <em>don't</em>; if you were using <code>-Ppdf</code>, add <code>-G0</code> to
suppress the implicit switch in the pseudo-printer file.
<p>The problem has been corrected in <i>dvips</i> v 5.90 (the
version distributed with the TeX-Live 7 CDROM and in other
TeX distributions from that date onwards).
