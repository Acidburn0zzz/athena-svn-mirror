<h3>"Missing number, treated as zero"</h3>
<p>In general, this means you've tried to assign something to a count,
dimension or skip register that isn't (in TeX's view of things) a
number.  Usually the problem will become clear using the


<a href="FAQ261.html">ordinary techniques of examining errors</a>.
<p>Two LaTeX-specific errors are commonly aired on the newsgroups.
<p>The first arises from a misconfiguration in a system that
has been upgraded from LaTeX 2.09: the document uses
<code>\usepackage{times}</code>, and the error appears at
<code>\begin{document}</code>: the likely cause is lurking files that
remain from the LaTeX 2.09 version of the <i>times</i> package.  The
<i>times</i> package in <i>psnfss</i> is a very simple beast,
but the LaTeX 2.09 version is quite complicated, and loads another
package: this is clear in the log if you have been "bitten" this
way.  The resolution is to clear out all the old PostScript-related
packages, and then to install <i>psnfss</i>.
<p>The second arises from attempting to use an example describe in

<a href="FAQ22.html"><em>The LaTeX Companion</em></a>, and is
exemplified by the following error text:
<pre>
! Missing number, treated as zero.
&lt;to be read again&gt; 
                   \relax 
l.21 \begin{Ventry}{Return values}
</pre>
The problem arises because the <em>Companion</em>'s examples always
assume that the <i>calc</i> package is loaded: this fact is
mentioned in the book, but often not noticed.  The remedy is to load
the <i>calc</i> package in any document using such examples from
the <em>Companion</em>.
