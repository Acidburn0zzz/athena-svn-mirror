<h3>Finding (La)TeX macro packages</h3>
<p>Before you ask for a TeX macro or LaTeX class or package file to
do something, try searching Graham Williams'

catalogue.  You can also


<a href="FAQ51.html">search the catalogue over the web</a>.
<p>If you have learnt of a file, by some other means,
that seems interesting, search a CTAN archive for it (see 
<a href="FAQ50.html">finding files on CTAN</a>). For packages
listed in 


<a href="FAQ22.html"><em>The LaTeX Companion</em></a>
the file  may be consulted as an alternative to
searching the archive's index. It lists the current location in the archive of
such files.
