<h3>Footnotes in captions</h3>
<p>Footnotes in captions are especially tricky: they present problems of
their own, on top of the problems one experiences with


<a href="FAQ184.html">footnotes in section titles</a> and with

<a href="FAQ183.html">footnotes in tables</a>.
<p>So <em>as well as</em> using the optional argument of <code>\caption</code> (or
whatever) to avoid the footnote migrating to the List of ..., and
putting the object whose caption bears the footnote in a minipage, one
<em>also</em> has to deal with the tendency of the <code>\caption</code> command
to produce the footnote's text twice.  For this last problem, there is
no tidy solution this author is aware of.  If you're suffering the
problem, a well-constructed <code>\caption</code> command in a <code>minipage</code>
environment within a float, such as:
<pre>
\begin{figure}
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
    ...
    \caption[Caption for LOF]%
      {Real caption\footnote{blah}}
  \end{minipage}
\end{figure}
</pre>
can produce <em>two</em> copies of the footnote body "blah".  (In
fact, the effect occurs with captions that are long enough to require
two lines to be typeset, and so wouldn't appear with such a short
caption.)  The <i>ccaption</i> package's documentation describes a
really rather awful work-around.
