<h3>Start of line goes awry</h3>
<p>This answer concerns two sorts of problems: errors of the form
<pre>
! Missing number, treated as zero.
&lt;to be read again&gt; 
                   g
&lt;*&gt; [grump]
</pre>
and those where a single asterisk at the start of a line mysteriously
fails to appear in the output.
<p>Both problems arise because <code>\</code><code>\</code> takes optional arguments.  The
command <code>\</code><code>\*</code> means "break the line here, and inhibit page break
following the line break"; the command <code>\</code><code>\[</code>&lt;<em>dimen</em>&gt;<code>]</code>
means "break the line here and add &lt;<em>dimen</em>&gt; extra vertical space
afterwards".
<p>So why does <code>\</code><code>\</code> get confused by these things at the start of a
line?  It's looking for the first non-blank thing, and in the test it
uses ignores the end of the line in your input text.
<p>The solution is to enclose the stuff at the start of the new line in
braces:
<pre>
{\ttfamily
  /* C-language comment\\
  {[grump]} I don't like this format\\
  {*}/
}
</pre>
(The above text derives from an actual post to
<i>comp.text.tex</i>; this particular bit of typesetting could
plainly also be done using the <code>verbatim</code> environment.)
<p>The problem also appears in maths mode, in arrays and so on.  In this
case, large-scale bracketing of things is <em>not</em> a good idea; the
TeX primitive <code></code> (which does nothing except to block
searches of this nature) may be used.  From another
<i>comp.text.tex</i> example:
<pre>
\begin{eqnarry}
  [a] &amp;=&amp; b \\
  \relax[a] &amp;=&amp; b
\end{eqnarry}
</pre>
