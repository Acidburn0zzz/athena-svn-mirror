<h3>How to alter the alignment of tabular cells</h3>
<p>One often needs to alter the alignment of a tabular <code>p</code> ('paragraph')
cell, but problems at the end of a table row are common.  If we have a
<code>p</code> cell that looks like
<pre>
... &amp; \centering blah ... \\
</pre>
one is liable to encounter errors that complain about a "misplaced
<code>\noalign</code>" (or the like).
The problem is that the command <code>\</code><code>\</code> means different things in
different circumstances: the <code>tabular</code> environment
switches the meaning to a value for use in the table, and
<code>\centering</code>, <code>\flushright</code> and <code>\flushleft</code> all change the
meaning to something incompatible.  Note that the problem only
arises in the last cell of a row: since each cell is set into a box,
its settings are lost at the <code>&amp;</code> (or <code>\</code><code>\</code>) that terminates it.
<p>The simple (old) solution is to preserve the meaning of <code>\</code><code>\</code>:
<pre>
\def\PBS#1{\let\temp=\\%
  #1%
  \let\\=\temp
}
</pre>
which one uses as:
<pre>
... &amp; \PBS\centering blah ... \\
</pre>
(for example).
<p>The technique using <code>\PBS</code> was developed in the days of LaTeX 2.09
because the actual value of <code>\</code><code>\</code> that the <code>tabular</code>
environment used was only available as an internal command.  Nowadays,
the value is a public command, and you can in principle use it
explicitly:
<pre>
... &amp; \centering blah ... \tabularnewline
</pre>
but the old trick has the advantage of extreme compactness.
<p>The <code>\PBS</code> trick also serves well in <i>array</i> package "field
format" preamble specifications:
<pre>
\begin{tabular}{... &gt;{\PBS\centering}p{50mm}}
...
</pre>
