<h3>Drawing with TeX</h3>
<p>There are many packages to do pictures in (La)TeX itself (rather than
importing graphics created externally), ranging from simple use of
LaTeX <code>picture</code> environment, through enhancements like
<i>epic</i>, to 
sophisticated (but slow) drawing with PiCTeX. Depending on your type
of drawing, and setup, four systems should be at the top of your list
to look at:
<ol>
<li> <i>pstricks</i>; this gives you access to all the power of
  PostScript from TeX itself, by sophisticated use of
  <code>\special</code>s. You need a decent DVI to PostScript driver
  (like <i>dvips</i>), but the results are worth it.  The
  well-documented package gives you not only low-level drawing
  commands (and full colour) like lines, circles, shapes at arbitrary
  coordinates, but also high-level macros for framing text, drawing
  trees and matrices, 3D effects, and more.  PDFTeX users
  may use <i>pdftricks</i>, which (like <i>epstopdf</i> - see
  <a href="FAQ91.html">PDFLaTeX graphics</a>) generates
  PDF files on the fly from <i>pstricks</i> commands.
<li> MetaPost; you liked Metafont, but never got to grips with font files?
  Try <a href="FAQ4.html">MetaPost</a> -
  all the power of Metafont, but it generates PostScript figures; MetaPost
  is nowadays part of most serious (La)TeX distributions.  Knuth
  uses it for all his work...
<li> <i>Mfpic</i>; you liked Metafont, but can't understand the
  language?  The package makes up Metafont or MetaPost code for you
  within using familiar-looking TeX macros.  Not <em>quite</em> the
  full power of Metafont, but a friendlier interface.
<li> You liked PiCTeX but don't have enough memory or time?  Look
  at Eitan Gurari's <i>dratex</i>, which is as powerful as most
  other TeX drawing packages, but is an entirely new
  implementation, which is not as hard on memory, is much more
  readable (and is fully documented).
