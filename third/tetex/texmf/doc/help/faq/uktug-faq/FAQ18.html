<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 18</title>

<h3>What is the future of TeX?</h3>
<p>Knuth has declared that he will do no further development of TeX;
he will continue to fix any bugs that are reported to him (though
bugs are rare).  This decision was made soon after
TeX version 3.0 was released; at each bug-fix release
the version number acquires one more digit, so that it tends to the
limit <i>pi</i> (at the time of writing, Knuth's latest release is version
3.14159).  Knuth wants TeX to be frozen at version <i>pi</i> when he
dies; thereafter, no further changes may be made to Knuth's source.
(A similar rule is applied to Metafont; its version number tends to the
limit <i>e</i>, and currently stands at 2.718.)
<p>There are projects (some of them long-term
projects: see, for example,
<a href="FAQ276.html">the LaTeX3 project</a>)

to build substantial
new macro packages based on TeX.  For the even longer term, there
are various projects to build a <em>successor</em> to TeX; see
<a href="FAQ277.html">the Omega project</a> and <a href="FAQ278.html">NTS</a>.
