<h3>Parallel setting of text</h3>
<p>It's commonly necessary to present text in two languages 'together' on
a page, or on opposite pages of a two-page spread.  For this to be
satisfactory, one also needs some sort of alignment between the two
texts.
<p>The <i>parallel</i> package satisfies these needs, permitting
typesetting in two columns (not necessarily of the same width) on one
page, or on two pages.
