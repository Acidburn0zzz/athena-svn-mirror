<h3>How many words have you written?</h3>
<p>One often has to submit a document (e.g., a paper or a dissertation)
under some sort of constraint about its size.  Sensible people set a
constraint in terms of numbers of pages, but there are some that
persist in limiting the numbers of words you type.
<p>A simple solution to the requirement can be achieved following a
simple observation: the powers that be are unlikely to count all the
words of a document submitted to them.  Therefore, a statistical
method can be employed: find how many words there are on a full page;
find how many full pages there are in the document (allowing for
displays of various sorts, this number will probably not be an
integer); multiply the two.  However, if the document to be submitted
is to determine the success of the rest of one's life, it takes a
brave person to thumb their nose at authority quite so
comprehensively...
<p>The simplest method is to strip out the (La)TeX markup, and to count
what's left.  On a  Unix-like system, this may be done using
<i>detex</i> and the built-in <i>wc</i>:
<pre>
  detex &lt;filename&gt; | wc -w
</pre>
<i>Winedt</i> (see <a href="FAQ55.html">editors and shells</a>)
in the Windows environment provides this functionality direct.
<p>Simply stripping (La)TeX markup isn't entirely reliable, however:
that markup itself may contribute typeset words, and this could be a
problem.  The <i>wordcount</i> package
contains a Bourne shell (i.e., typically Unix) script for running a
LaTeX file with a special piece of supporting TeX code, and then
counting word indications in the log file.  This is probably as
accurate automatic counting as you can get.
