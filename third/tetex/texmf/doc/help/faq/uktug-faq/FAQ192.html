<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 192</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Bits of document from other directories</h3>
<p>A common way of constructing a large document is to break it into a
set of files (for example, one per chapter) and to keep everything
related to each of these subsidiary files in a subdirectory.
<p>Unfortunately, TeX doesn't have a changeable "current directory",
so that all files you refer to have to be specified relative to the
same directory as the main file.  Most people find this
counter-intuitive.
<p>It may be appropriate to use the "path extension" technique

<a href="FAQ115.html">used in temporary installations</a> to deal with
this problem.  However, if there several files with the same name in
your document, such as <i>chapter1/fig1.eps</i> and
<i>chapter2/fig1.eps</i>, you're not giving TeX any hint as to
which you're referring to when in the main chapter file you say
<code>\input{sect1}</code>; while this is readily soluble in the case of
human-prepared files (just don't name them all the same),
automatically produced files have a way of having repetitious names,
and changing <em>them</em> is a procedure prone to error.
<p>The <i>import</i> package comes to your help here: it defines an
<code>\import</code> command that accepts a full path name and the name of a
file in that directory, and arranges things to "work properly".
So, for example, if <i>/home/friend/results.tex</i> contains
<pre>
  Graph: \includegraphics{picture}
  \input{explanation}
</pre>
then <code>\import{/home/friend/}{results}</code> will include both
graph and explanation as one might hope.  A <code>\subimport</code> command
does the same sort of thing for a subdirectory (a relative path rather
than an absolute one), and there are corresponding <code>\includefrom</code>
and <code>\subincludefrom</code> commands.
