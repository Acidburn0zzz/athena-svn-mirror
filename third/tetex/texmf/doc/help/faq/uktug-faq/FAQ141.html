<h3>Typesetting things in landscape orientation</h3>
<p>It's often necessary to typeset part of a document in landscape
orientation; to achieve this, one needs not only to change the page
dimensions, but also to instruct the output device to print the
strange page differently.
<p>There are two "ordinary" mechanisms for doing two slight variations
of landscape typesetting:
<ul>
<li> If you have a single floating object that is wider than it is
  deep, and will only fit on the page in landscape orientation, use
  the <i>rotating</i> package; this defines <code>sidewaysfigure</code> and
  <code>sidewaystable</code> environments which create floats that
  occupy a whole page.
<li> If you have a long sequence of things that need to be typeset in
  landscape (perhaps a code listing, a wide <code>tabbing</code>
  environment, or a huge table typeset using <i>longtable</i> or
  <i>supertabular</i>), use the <i>lscape</i> package (or
  <i>pdflscape</i> if you're generating PDF output).  This
  defines an environment <code>landscape</code>, which clears the current page
  and restarts typesetting in landscape orientation (and clears the
  page at the end of the environment before returning to portrait
  orientation).
</ul>
No currently available package makes direct provision for typesetting
in both portrait and landscape orientation on the same page (it's not
the sort of thing that TeX is well set-up to do).  If such
behaviour was an absolute necessity, one would use the techniques
described in

<a href="FAQ176.html">"flowing text around figures"</a>, and would
rotate the landscape portion using the rotation facilities of the
<i>graphics</i> package.  (Returning from landscape to portrait
orientation would be somewhat easier: the portrait part of the page
would be a bottom float at the end of the landscape section, with its
content rotated.)
<p>To set an entire document in landscape orientation, one might use
<i>lscape</i> around the whole document.  A better option is the
<code>landscape</code> option of the <i>geometry</i> package; if you also give
it <code>dvips</code> or <code>pdftex</code> option, <i>geometry</i> also emits the
rotation instructions to cause the output to be properly oriented.
<p>A word of warning: most current TeX previewers do not honour
rotation requests in <code>.dvi</code> files (the exceptions are the
  (<a href="FAQ56.html">commercial</a>) Y&amp;Y previewer
  <i>dviwindo</i>,

and the fpTeX previewer WinDVI).  If your previewer is not
capable of rotation, your best bet is to convert your output to
PostScript or to PDF, and to view these 'final' forms with an
appropriate viewer.
