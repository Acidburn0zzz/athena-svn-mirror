<h3>What is Texinfo?</h3>
<p>Texinfo is a documentation system that uses one source file to produce
both on-line information and printed output.  So instead of writing
two different documents, one for the on-line help and the other for a
typeset manual, you need write only one document source file.  When
the work is revised, you need only revise one document.  You can read
the on-line information, known as an "Info file", with an Info
documentation-reading program.  By convention, Texinfo source file
names end with a <code>.texi</code> or <code>.texinfo</code> extension.  You can write and
format Texinfo files into Info files within GNU
<i>emacs</i>, and read them using the <i>emacs</i> Info
reader.  You can also format Texinfo files into Info files using
<i>makeinfo</i> and read them using <i>info</i>, so you're not
dependent on <i>emacs</i>.  The distribution includes a
<i>Perl</i> script, <i>texi2html</i>, that will convert
Texinfo sources into HTML.
