<h3>Set specifications and Dirac brackets</h3>
<p>One of the few glaring omissions from TeX's mathematical
typesetting capabilities is a means of setting separators in the
middle of mathematical expressions.  TeX provides primitives called
<code>\left</code> and <code>\right</code>, which can be used to modify brackets (of
whatever sort) around a mathematical expression, as in:

<code>\left( &lt;expression&gt; \right)</code> - the size of the parentheses is
matched to the vertical extent of the expression.
<p>However, in all sorts of mathematical enterprises one may find oneself
needing a <code>\middle</code> command, to be used in expressions like
<pre>
  \left\{ x\in \mathbb{N} \middle| x \mbox{ even} \right\}
</pre>

to specify the set of even natural numbers.  The

<a href="FAQ278.html">e-TeX system</a>
defines just such a command, but users of Knuth's original need some
support.  Donald Arseneau's <i>braket</i> package provides commands
for set specifications (as above) and for Dirac brackets (and bras and
kets).  The package uses the e-TeX built-in command if it finds
itself running under e-TeX.
