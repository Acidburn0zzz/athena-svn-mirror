<h3>Extra vertical space in floats</h3>
<p>A common complaint is that extra vertical space has crept into
<code>figure</code> or \environment{table} floating environments.
More common still are users who post code that introduces this extra
space, and <em>haven't noticed the problem</em>!
<p>The trouble arises from the fact that the <code>center</code>
environment (and its siblings <code>flushleft</code> and
<code>flushright</code>) are actually based on LaTeX's
list-handling code; and lists always separate themselves from the
material around them.  Meanwhile, there are parameters provided to
adjust the spacing between floating environments and their
surroundings; so if we have:
<pre>
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics{...}
  \caption{...}
 \end{center}
\end{figure}
</pre>
or worse still:
<pre>
\begin{figure}
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics{...}
 \end{center}
 \caption{...}
\end{figure}
</pre>
unwarranted vertical space is going to appear.
<p>The solution is to let the float and the objects in it position
themselves, and to use "generic" layout commands rather than their
list-based encapsulations.
<pre>
\begin{figure}
 \centering
 \includegraphics{...}
 \caption{...}
\end{figure}
</pre>
(which even involves less typing).
<p>This alternative code will work with any LaTeX package.  It will
not work with obsolete (pre-LaTeX2e) packages such as
<i>psfig</i> or <i>epsf</i> - see 
<a href="FAQ89.html">graphics inclusion</a> for discussion of the
genesis of <code>\includegraphics</code>.
