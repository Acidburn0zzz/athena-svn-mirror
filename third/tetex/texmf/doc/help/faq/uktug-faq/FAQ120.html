<h3><em>Curriculum Vitae</em> (Resum&eacute;)</h3>
<p>A framework class, <i>vita</i>, for <em>Curricula Vitae</em> is
provided by Andrej Brodnik.
<p>The class can be customised both for subject (example class option
files are offered for both computer scientists and singers), and for
language (both the options provided are available for both English and
Slovene).  Extensions may be written by creating new class option
files, or by using macros defined in the class to define new entry
types, etc.
<p>Didier Verna's class, <i>curve</i>, is based on a model in which
the CV is made of a set of <em>rubrics</em> (each one dealing
with a major item that you want to discuss, such as 'education', 'work
experience', etc.  The class's documentation is supported by a couple
of example files, and an emacs mode is provided.
<p>The alternative to using a separate class is to impose a package on
one of the standard classes.  An example,
Axel Reichert's <i>currvita</i> package, has been recommended to the
FAQ team.  Its output certainly looks good.
<p>There is also a LaTeX 2.09 package <i>resume</i>, which comes with
little but advice <em>against</em> trying to use it.
