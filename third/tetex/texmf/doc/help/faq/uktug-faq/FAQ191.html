<h3>Conditional compilation and "comments"</h3>
<p>While LaTeX (or any other TeX-derived package) isn't really like a
compiler, people regularly want to do compiler-like things using it.
Common requirements are conditional 'compilation' and 'block
comments', and several LaTeX-specific means to this end are available.
<p>The simple <code>\newcommand{<code>\gobble</code>}[1]</code><code>{</code><code>}</code> and 
<code>\iffalse</code><code> ... </code><code>\fi</code> aren't really satisfactory (as a general
solution) for comments, since the matter being skipped is nevertheless
scanned by TeX.  The scanning imposes restrictions one what you're
allowed to skip; this may not be a problem in <em>today's</em> job, but
could return to bite you tomorrow.  Furthermore, <code>\gobble</code> is pretty
inefficient for any but trivial arguments, since all the matter to be
skipped is copied to the argument stack before being ignored.
<p>If your requirement is for a document from which whole chapters (or
the like) are missing, consider the LaTeX
<code>\include</code>/<code>\includeonly</code> system.  If you '<code>\include</code>' your
files (rather than <code>\input</code> them - see 

<a href="FAQ252.html">What's going on in my <code>\include</code> commands?</a>),
LaTeX writes macro traces of what's going on at the end of each
chapter to the <code>.aux</code> file; by using <code>\includeonly</code>, you can give
LaTeX an exhaustive list of the files that are needed.  Files that
don't get <code>\include</code>d are skipped entirely, but the document
processing continues as if they <em>were</em> there, and page, footnote,
and other numbers are not disturbed.  Note that you can choose which
sections you want included interactively, using the
<i>askinclude</i> package.
<p>If you want to select particular pages of your document, use Heiko
Oberdiek's <i>pagesel</i> or the <i>selectp</i> packages.  You
can do something similar with an existing PDF document (which
you may have compiled using <i>pdflatex</i> in the first place),
using the <i>pdfpages</i> package.  The job is then done with a
document looking like:
<pre>
  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage[final]{pdfpages}
  \begin{document}
  \includepdf[pages=30-40]{yoursource.pdf}
  \end{document}
</pre>
(To include all of the document, you write
<pre>
  \includepdf[pages=-]{yoursource.pdf}
</pre>
omitting the start and end pages in the optional argument.)
<p>If you want flexible facilities for including or excluding small
portions of a file, consider the <i>comment</i>, <i>version</i> or
<i>optional</i> packages.
<p><i>comment</i> allows you to declare areas of a document to be
included or excluded; you make these declarations in the preamble of
your file.  Its exclusion method is pretty robust, and can cope with
ill-formed bunches of text (e.g., with unbalanced braces or <code>\if</code>
commands).
<p><i>version</i> offers similar facilities to <i>comment.sty</i>;
it's far "lighter weight", but is less robust (and in particular,
cannot deal with very large areas of text being included/excluded).
<p><i>optional</i> defines a command <code>\opt</code>; its first argument is
an 'inclusion flag', and its second is text to be included or
excluded.  Text to be included or excluded must be well-formed
(nothing mismatched), and should not be too big - if a large body of
text is needed, <code>\input</code> should be used in the argument.
The documentation (in the package file itself) tells you
how to declare which sections are to be included: this can be done in
the document preamble, but the documentation also suggests ways in
which it can be done on the command line that invokes LaTeX, or
interactively.
<p>Finally, <i>verbatim</i> (which should be available
in any distribution) defines a <code>comment</code> environment, which
enables the dedicated user of the source text editor to suppress bits of
a LaTeX source file.
