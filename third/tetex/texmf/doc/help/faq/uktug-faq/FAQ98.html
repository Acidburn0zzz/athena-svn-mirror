<h3>Creating a bibliography style</h3>
<p>It <em>is</em> possible to write your own: the standard bibliography
styles are distributed in a commented form, and there is a description
of the language (see

<a href="FAQ31.html">BibTeX documentation</a>).
However, it must be admitted that the language in which BibTeX
styles are written is pretty obscure, and one would not recommend
anyone who's not a confident programmer to write their own, though
minor changes to an existing style may be within the grasp of many.
<p>If your style isn't too 'far out', you can probably generate it by
using the facilities of the <i>custom-bib</i> bundle.  This
contains a file <i>makebst.tex</i>, which runs you through a text menu
to produce a file of instructions, with which you can generate your
own <code>.bst</code> file.  This technique doesn't deal with entirely new styles
of document (the present author needed "standards committee papers"
and "ISO standards" for his dissertation; another
commonly-required type is the Web page - see

<a href="FAQ102.html">URLs in bibliographies</a>).
