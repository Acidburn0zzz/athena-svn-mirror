<h3>Preventing hyphenation of a particular word</h3>
<p>It's quite possible for (<em>any</em>) hyphenation of a particular word
to seem "completely wrong", so that you want to prevent it being
hyphenated.
<p>If the word occurs in just one place, put it in a box:
<pre>
  \mbox{oddword}
</pre>
(Plain TeX users should use <code>\hbox</code>, and take care at the start
of paragraphs.)  However, boxing the word is not really advisable
unless you are sure it only occurs once.
<p>If the word occurs commonly, the best choice is to assert a
non-hyphenation for it:
<pre>
  \hyphenation{oddword}
</pre>
This hyphenation exception (with no break points) will be used in
preference to what TeX's hyphenation algorithm may come up with.
<p>In a multilingual document, repeat the exception specification for
each language the word may appear in.  So:
<pre>
  \usepackage[french,english]{babel}
  \selectlanguage{english}
  \hyphenation{oddword}
  \selectlanguage{french}
  \hyphenation{oddword}
</pre>
(note that <i>babel</i> will select the default language for the
document - English, in this case - at <code>\begin{document}</code>.)
