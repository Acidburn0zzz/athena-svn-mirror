<dt>Unix<dd> Instructions for retrieving the <i>web2c</i> Unix
  TeX distribution via anonymous <code>ftp</code> are to be found in
  <i>unixtex.ftp</i>, though nowadays the sensible installer will
  take (and possibly customise) one of the packaged distributions such
  as teTeX (which often has a more recent version of
  <i>web2c</i> embedded than has been released "in the wild"), or the
  TeX Live CDROM (see <a href="FAQ53.html">TeX CDROMs</a>).
<p>  For teTeX, you need a <code>.tar.gz</code> file for each of <code>teTeX-src</code>,
  <code>teTeX-texmf</code> and <code>teTeX-texmfsrc</code>
<p>  As yet, no sets of teTeX binaries are available; however,
  compilation of this version of teTeX has been pretty
  comprehensively tested under a wide variety of operating systems.
  If you don't have the means to compile teTeX yourself, your best
  bet is to use one of the current TeX-live discs, which offer a
  good range of binaries, not much older than teTeX.
<p>  MacOS X users should refer to the information below,
  under item "Mac".

  TeX to run on Linux, NTeX and teTeX (see above).
<p>  The most recent offering is a free version of the
  commercial

<dt>PC; MSDOS or OS/2<dd> EmTeX, by Eberhard Mattes,
  includes LaTeX, BibTeX, previewers, and drivers, and is
  available  as a series of zip archives.  Documentation is
  available in both German and English.  Appropriate memory managers
  for using emTeX with 386 (and better) processors and under
  Windows, are included in the distribution.  EmTeX will operate
  under Windows, but Windows users are better advised to use a
  distribution tailored for the Windows environment.
<p>  A version of emTeX, packaged to use a
  
  
  <a href="FAQ44.html">TDS directory structure</a>, is separately
  available as an emTeX 'contribution'.

<dt>PC: Win32<dd>
  fpTeX, by Fabrice Popineau, is a version of teTeX for Windows
  systems.  As such, it is particularly attractive to those who need
  to switch back and forth between Windows and Unix environments, and
  to administrators who need to maintain both (fpTeX can use the
  same <code>texmf</code> tree as a teTeX installation).  fpTeX's
  previewer (<i>Windvi</i>) is based on <i>xdvi</i>, and takes
  advantage of extra facilities in the Win32 environment.
  <i>Windvi</i> is capable of printing directly, and a version of
  <i>dvips</i> is also available.
<p>  MikTeX, by Christian Schenk, is also a comprehensive
  distribution, developed separately from the teTeX work.  It has
  its own previewer, YAP, which is itself capable of printing,
  though the distribution also includes a port of <i>dvips</i>.
  The current version is available for file-by-file download (the
  HTML files in the directory offer hints
  on what you need to get going).  A prepackaged version of the whole
  directory is also available.
<p>  A further (free) option arises from the
  <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">"CygWin" bundle</a>, which presents a
  Unix-like environment over the Win32 interface; an X-windows server
  is available.  If you run CygWin on your Windows machine, you have
  the option of using teTeX, too (you will need the X-server, to
  run <i>xdvi</i>).  Of course, teTeX components will look like
  Unix applications (but that's presumably what you wanted), but it's
  also reputedly somewhat slower than native Win32 implementations
  such as MikTeX or fpTeX.  TeTeX is available as part of the
  CygWin distribution (in the same way that a version is available
  with most Linux distributions, nowadays), and you may also build
  your own copy from the current sources.
<p>  BaKoMa TeX, by Basil Malyshev, is a comprehensive (shareware)
  distribution, which focuses on support of Acrobat.  The distribution
  comes with a bunch of Type 1 fonts packaged to work with BaKoMa
  TeX, which further the focus.

<dt>Mac<dd> OzTeX, by Andrew Trevorrow, is a shareware version of
  TeX for the Macintosh.  A DVI previewer and PostScript
  driver are also included.


<p>  UK TUG prepays the shareware fee, so that its members may
  acquire the software without further payment.  Questions about
  OzTeX may be directed to <a href="mailto:oztex@midway.uchicago.edu"><i>oztex@midway.uchicago.edu</i></a>
<p>  Another partly shareware program is CMacTeX, put together
  by Tom Kiffe. This is much closer 
  to the Unix TeX setup (it uses <i>dvips</i>, for instance).
  CMacTeX includes a port of the latest version of
  <a href="FAQ277.html">Omega</a>.
<p>  Both OzTeX and CMacTeX are additionally available on
  
  <a href="http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/versionsX.html">MacOS X</a>,
  but OS X users also have the option of a build of
  teTeX by Gerben Wierda.  This is naturally usable from the
  command line, just like any other Unix-based system, but it can also
  be used Mac-style as the engine behind Richard Koch's (free)
  TeXShop, which is an integrated TeX editor and previewer.
<p>

<dt>TOPS-20<dd> TeX was originally written on a DEC-10

  and so was easily ported to TOPS-20. A distribution that runs on
  TOPS-20 is available via anonymous <code>ftp</code> from <a href="ftp://ftp.math.utah.edu/">ftp.math.utah.edu</a>
  in <i>pub/tex/pub/web</i>
