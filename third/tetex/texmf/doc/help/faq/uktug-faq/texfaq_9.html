<DL>
<DT>troff
<DD><I>troff-to-latex</I> (available as
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/troff-to-latex"><TT>support/troff-to-latex</TT></A>), written by Kamal Al-Yahya at Stanford
  University (California, USA), assists in the translation of a
  <I>troff</I> document into LaTeX format.  It recognises most
  <CODE>-ms</CODE> and <CODE>-man</CODE> macros, plus most <I>eqn</I> and some
  <I>tbl</I> preprocessor commands.  Anything fancier needs to be
  done by hand. Two style files are provided. There is also a man page
  (which converts very well to LaTeX...).  The program is
  copyrighted but free. An enhanced version of this program,
  <I>tr2latex</I>, is available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/tr2latex"><TT>support/tr2latex</TT></A>

<P>
  The DECUS TeX distribution (see
  <A HREF="texfaq_4.html#QU34">sources of software</A>)
  also contains a program which converts <I>troff</I> to TeX.


<DT>WordPerfect
<DD><I>wp2latex</I> (available as
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/wp2latex"><TT>support/wp2latex</TT></A>) is a PC program
  written in Turbo Pascal by R. C. Houtepen at the Eindhoven
  University in the Netherlands. It converts <I>WordPerfect</I>
  5.0 documents to LaTeX. Pascal source is included.  Users find it
  ``helpful'' and ``decent'' in spite of some limitations. It gets
  high marks for handling font changes, but cannot make
  indices, tables of contents, margins or graphics, and can't
  handle features new in <I>WordPerfect</I> version 5.1, in particular
  the equation formatter. The program is copyrighted but free.

<P>
  Glenn Geers of the University of Sydney, Australia
  (<SAMP>glenn@qed.physics.su.oz.au</SAMP>) is translating
  <I>wp2latex</I> into C and adding some <I>WordPerfect</I>
  5.1 features, in particular its equation handling. His work is in
  the <TT>glenn</TT> subdirectory of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/wp2latex"><TT>support/wp2latex</TT></A>


<DT>PC-Write
<DD><CODE>pcwritex.arc</CODE>, from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/pcwritex"><TT>support/pcwritex</TT></A>, is a
  print driver for PC-Write that ``prints'' a PC-Write
  V2.71 document to a TeX-compatible disk file.  It was written by Peter
  Flynn at University College, Cork, Republic of Ireland.


<DT>runoff
<DD>Peter Vanroose's (<SAMP>vanroose@esat.kuleuven.ac.be</SAMP>)
  conversion program is written in VMS Pascal.
  The sources and a VAX executable are available from
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/rnototex"><TT>support/rnototex</TT></A>


<DT>refer/tib
<DD>There are a few programs for converting bibliographic
  data between BibTeX and <I>refer</I>/<I>tib</I> formats.
  They are in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/utils/refer-tools"><TT>biblio/bibtex/utils/refer-tools</TT></A>

<P>
  In spite of the directory name, it also contains a shell script to
  convert BibTeX to <I>refer</I> as well. The collection
  is not maintained.


<DT>RTF
<DD>A program for converting Microsoft's Rich Text Format to
  TeX is available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/rtf2tex"><TT>support/rtf2tex</TT></A>, which was written and is
  maintained by Robert Lupton (<SAMP>rhl@astro.princeton.edu</SAMP>).
  There is also a convertor to LaTeX by Erwin Wechtl, in
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/rtf2latex"><TT>support/rtf2latex</TT></A>

<P>
  Translation <EM>to</EM> RTF may be done (for a somewhat
  constrained set of LaTeX documents) by TeX2RTF, which
  can produce ordinary RTF, Windows Help RTF (as well as
  HTML, <A HREF="texfaq_9.html#QU53">conversion to HTML</A>).
  TeX2RTF is supported on various Unix platforms and under
  Windows 3.1; it is available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/tex2rtf"><TT>support/tex2rtf</TT></A>


<DT>Microsoft Word
<DD>A rudimentary program for converting MS-Word to
  LaTeX is wd2latex, for MS-DOS (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/dviware/wd2latex"><TT>dviware/wd2latex</TT></A>); a better
  idea, however, is to convert the document to RTF format and use one
  of the RTF converters mentioned above.
</DL>

<P>
A FAQ that deals specifically with conversions between
TeX-based formats and word processor formats is regularly posted to
<SAMP>comp.text.tex</SAMP>, is available via
<A HREF="http://www.kfa-juelich.de/isr/1/texconv/texconv.html"><TT>http://www.kfa-juelich.de/isr/1/texconv/texconv.html</TT></A> and is archived as
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/help/wp-conv/wp-conv.zip"><TT>help/wp-conv/wp-conv.zip</TT></A>

<P>
A group at Ohio State University (USA) is working on
a common document format based on SGML, with the ambition that any
format could be
translated to or from this one.  <I>FrameMaker</I> provides
``import filters'' to aid translation from alien formats
(presumably including TeX) to <I>Framemaker</I>'s own.


<H2><A NAME="QU51">Conversion from (La)TeX to plain ASCII</A></H2>

<P>
The aim here is to emulate the Unix <I>nroff</I>, which formats
text as best it can for the screen, from the same
input as the Unix typesetting program <I>troff</I>.

<P>
Ralph Droms (<SAMP>droms@bucknell.edu</SAMP>) has a style file and a
program that provide the LaTeX equivalent of <I>nroff</I>,
though it doesn't do a good job with tables and mathematics. The
software is available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/txt"><TT>support/txt</TT></A>; the original
<I>dvi2tty</I> often does an acceptable job and is available in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/dviware/dvi2tty"><TT>dviware/dvi2tty</TT></A>

<P>
Another possibility is to use <TT>screen.sty</TT> (available as
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex209/contrib/misc/screen.sty"><TT>macros/latex209/contrib/misc/screen.sty</TT></A>). Use a <I>dvi2tty</I> program of some kind;
you might try <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/dviware/crudetype"><TT>dviware/crudetype</TT></A> as well.  Another possibility is to
use the LaTeX-to-ASCII conversion program, <I>l2a</I>
(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/l2a"><TT>support/l2a</TT></A>), although this is really more of a de-TeXing
program.

<P>
The canonical de-TeXing program is <I>detex</I>
(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/detex"><TT>support/detex</TT></A>), which removes all comments and control sequences
from its input before writing it to its output.  Its original purpose
was to prepare input for a dumb spelling checker.


<H2><A NAME="QU52">Conversion from SGML or HTML to TeX</A></H2>

<P>
SGML is a very important system for document storage and interchange,
but it has no formatting features; its companion ISO standard
DSSSL
(<A HREF="http://www.jclark.com/dsssl/"><TT>http://www.jclark.com/dsssl/</TT></A>) is designed for writing
transformations and formatting,
but this has not yet been widely implemented. Some SGML authoring
systems (e.g., SoftQuad <I>Author/Editor</I>) have formatting
abilities, and
there are high-end specialist SGML typesetting systems (e.g., Miles33's
<I>Genera</I>).  However, the majority of SGML users probably transform
the source to an existing typesetting system when they want to print. 
TeX is a good candidate for this. There are three approaches to writing a
translator:
<OL>
<LI> Write a free-standing translator in the traditional way, with
  tools like <I>yacc</I> and <I>lex</I>; this is hard, in
  practice, because of the complexity of SGML.
<LI> Use a specialist language designed for SGML transformations; the
  best known are probably <I>Omnimark</I> and <I>Balise</I>.
  They are expensive, but powerful, incorporating SGML query and
  transformation abilities as well as simple translation.
<LI> Build a translator on top of an existing SGML parser.  By far
  the best-known (and free!) parser is James Clark's
  <I>nsgmls</I>, and this produces a much simpler output format,
  called ESIS, which can be parsed quite straightforwardly (one also
  has the benefit of an SGML parse against the DTD). Two
  good public domain packages use this method:
  <UL>
    <LI> David Megginson's <I>sgmlspm</I>, written in Perl 5.
      Available from
      <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/SGMLS"><TT>http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/SGMLS</TT></A>
    <LI> Joachim Schrod and Christine Detig's <I>stil</I>, written in
      Common Lisp. Available from
      <A HREF="ftp://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/text/sgml/stil"><TT>ftp://ftp.th-darmstadt.de/pub/text/sgml/stil</TT></A>
  </UL>
  Both of these allow the user to write `handlers' for every SGML
  element, with plenty of access to attributes, entities, and
  information about the context within the document tree.

<P>
  If these packages don't meet your needs for an average SGML
  typesetting job, you need the big commercial stuff.
</OL>

<P>
Since HTML is simply an example of SGML, we do not need a specific
system for HTML.  However, Nathan Torkington
(<SAMP>Nathan.Torkington@vuw.ac.nz</SAMP>) developed
<I>html2latex</I> from the HTML parser in NCSA's
Xmosaic package.
The program takes an HTML file and generates a LaTeX file from it.
The conversion code is subject to NCSA restrictions, but the whole
source is available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/html2latex"><TT>support/html2latex</TT></A>

<P>
Michel Goossens and Janne Saarela published a very useful summary of
SGML, and of public domain tools for writing and manipulating it, in
<CITE>TUGboat</CITE> 16(2).


<H2><A NAME="QU53">(La)TeX conversion to HTML</A></H2>

<P>
TeX is a typesetting language, not a markup system.
With properly-used LaTeX, you may  be luckier, 
but don't expect a free lunch. Remember that a) if you want a really
good Web document, you had better redesign it from scratch, and b) HTML 
(even HTML3) has pretty poor `typesetting' facilities, and anything
beyond the trivial will probably need to end up a graphic.

<P>
LaTeX2HTML (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/latex2html"><TT>support/latex2html</TT></A>) is a package by Nikos Drakos
(mostly of <I>perl</I> scripts) that breaks up a LaTeX document
into one or more components, and links them together so that they can
be read over the World-Wide Web as an hypertext document.
It defines a mapping between LaTeX intra-document
references and hyperlinks, and extends the
mechanisms to permit reference to other (possibly remote) documents
and other Internet resources.  It translates LaTeX accented and
other characters (as best it can) to things that World-Wide Web
browsers can display, and translates mathematics
(and other things that browsers can't deal with) to
images that can be loaded in-line into the hypertext document.

<P>
LaTeX2HTML needs <I>Perl</I>, the PBM utilities,
<I>dvips</I>, <I>GhostScript</I>, and other sundries; it
assumes it is running on a Unix system.
Michel Goossens and Janne Saarela published a detailed discussion of
LaTeX2HTML, and how to tailor it, in <CITE>TUGboat</CITE> 16(2).

<P>
There are two alternative strategies:
<OL>
<LI> Free-standing LaTeX to HTML translations. Hard, but
  not impossible.  Julian Smart's <I>latex2rtf</I> (available from
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/latex2rtf"><TT>support/latex2rtf</TT></A>) does a plausible job on a subset of LaTeX;
<LI> Writing an HTML-output backend in LaTeX itself.  See
  Sebastian Rahtz' paper in <CITE>TUGboat</CITE> 16(3) for a discussion of how
  to go about this for the general case of SGML.
</OL>


<H2><A NAME="QU54">Making hypertext documents from TeX</A></H2>

<P>
If you want on-line hypertext with a (La)TeX source, probably on the
World Wide Web, consider four technologies (which overlap):
<OL>
<LI> Try direct LaTeX conversion to HTML; see
  <A HREF="texfaq_9.html#QU53">(La)TeX conversion to HTML</A>;
<LI> Rewrite your document using Texinfo
  (see <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU13">Texinfo macro package</A>), and
  convert that to HTML;
<LI> Look at Adobe Acrobat, an electronic delivery system guaranteed
  to preserve your typesetting perfectly.
  See <A HREF="texfaq_9.html#QU55">Making Acrobat documents from LaTeX</A>;
<LI> Invest in the hyperTeX conventions (standardised <CODE>\special</CODE>
  commands); there are supporting macro packages for plain TeX and
  LaTeX).
</OL>

<P>
The HyperTeX project aims to extend the functionality of all the
LaTeX cross-referencing commands (including the table of contents)
to produce <CODE>\special</CODE> commands which are parsed by DVI processors
conforming to the HyperTeX guidelines;
it provides general hypertext links, including those
to external documents.

<P>
The HyperTeX specification says that conformant viewers/translators
must recognize the following set of <CODE>\special</CODE> commands:
<DL>
<DT>href:
<DD><CODE>html:&lt;a href = &quot;href_string&quot;&gt;</CODE>
<DT>name:
<DD><CODE>html:&lt;a name = &quot;name_string&quot;&gt;</CODE>
<DT>end:
<DD><CODE>html:&lt;/a&gt;</CODE>
<DT>image:
<DD><CODE>html:&lt;img src = &quot;href_string&quot;&gt;</CODE>
<DT>base_name:
<DD><CODE>html:&lt;base href = &quot;href_string&quot;&gt;</CODE>
</DL>

<P>
The <EM>href</EM>, <EM>name</EM> and <EM>end</EM> commands are used to do
the basic hypertext operations of establishing links between sections
of documents. 

<P>
Further details are available on <A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/"><TT>http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/</TT></A>; there
are two commonly-used implementations of the specification, a
modified <I>xdvi</I> and (recent releases of) <I>dvips</I>. Output from the
latter may be used in recent releases of <I>GhostScript</I> or Acrobat Distiller.


<H2><A NAME="QU55">Making Acrobat documents from LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
There are now two general routes to Acrobat output: Adobe's original
`distillation' route, and the use of PDFTeX (see
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU120">the PDFTeX project</A>).

<P>
For simple documents (with no hyper-references), you can either
<UL>
<LI> distill `ordinary' PostScript output of your document, or (on a
  Windows or Macintosh machine with <I>Acrobat Exchange</I>
  installed) pass it through the PDFwriter in place of a
  printer, or
<LI> process with PDFTeX, enabling Acrobat output.
</UL>
(Note that the PDFwriter route is a dead end: it can only be
used in this simple mode, as it cannot create hyperlinks.)

<P>
To translate all the LaTeX cross-referencing into Acrobat
links, you need a LaTeX package to suitably redefine
the internal commands.  There are two of these for LaTeX2e, both
based on the HyperTeX specification 
(see <A HREF="texfaq_9.html#QU54">Making hypertext documents from TeX</A>):
Sebastian Rahtz's <I>hyperref</I> (available from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref</TT></A>), and Michael Mehlich's
<I>hyper</I> (available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyper"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyper</TT></A>). <I>Hyperref</I>
can operate using PDFTeX primitives rather than the hyperTeX
conventions.
You can use
<I>dvips</I> or Y&Y's \PROGNAME|DVIPSONE|
to translate the DVI into PostScript acceptable to
Distiller.

<P>
Sadly, there is no free implementation of all of Distiller's
functionality, but <I>GhostScript</I> (version 4.00 onwards)
provides some restricted distilling capability, and
<I>Distiller</I> itself is now remarkably cheap (for academics at least).

<P>
Adobe's <I>Acrobat Reader</I> is available for a very wide range
of platforms.  For those still omitted,
<I>GhostScript</I> (versions 3.51 onwards) can display
and print PDF files.

<P>
Work on a DVI to PDF translator is in progress, but
shows no sign of immediate release (Sergey Lesenko spoke about the
work at TUG'96 and again at TUG'97).
