<h3>Cancelling <code>\ragged</code> commands</h3>
<p>LaTeX provides commands <code>\raggedright</code> and <code>\raggedleft</code>, but
none to cancel their effect.
<p>The following code (to be inserted in a package of your own, or as


<a href="FAQ229.html">internal LaTeX code</a>) defines a command that
restores flush justification at both margins:
<pre>
\def\flushboth{%
  \let\\\@normalcr
  \@rightskip\z@skip \rightskip\@rightskip
  \leftskip\z@skip
  \parindent 1.5em\relax}
</pre>
There's a problem with the setting of <code>\parindent</code> in the code: it's
necessary because both the <code>\ragged</code> commands set <code>\parindent</code> to
zero, but the setting isn't a constant of nature: documents using a
standard LaTeX class with <code>twocolumn</code> option will have <code>1.0em</code> by
default, and there's no knowing what you (or some other class) will
have done.
