<h3>How to ask a question</h3>
<p>You want help from the community at large; you've decided where you're
going to 

<a href="FAQ25.html">ask your question</a>, but how do you
phrase it?
<p>Excellent "general" advice (how to ask questions of anyone) is
contained in

<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">Eric Raymond's article on the topic</a>.
Eric's an extremely self-confident person, and this comes through in
his advice; but his guidelines are very good, even for us in the
un-self-confident majority.  It's important to remember that you don't
have a right to advice from the world, but that if you express
yourself well, you will usually find someone who will be pleased to
help.
<p>So how do you express yourself in the (La)TeX world?  There aren't
any comprehensive rules, but a few guidelines may help in the
application of your own common sense.
<ol>
<li> Make sure you're asking the right people.  Don't ask in a TeX
  forum about printer device drivers for the <i>Foobar</i>
  operating system.  Yes, TeX users need printers, but no, TeX
  users will typically <em>not</em> be <i>Foobar</i> systems
  managers.
<p>  Similarly, avoid posing a question in a language that the majority
  of the group don't use: post in Ruritanian to
  <i>de.comp.text.tex</i> and you may have a long wait before a
  German- and Ruritanian-speaking TeX expert notices your
  question.
<li> If your question is (or may be) TeX-system-specific, report
  what system you're using, or intend to use: "I can't install
  TeX" is as good as useless, whereas "I'm trying to install the
  <i>mumbleTeX</i> distribution on the <i>Grobble</i>
  operating system" gives all the context a potential respondent
  might need.  Another common situation where this information is
  important is when you're having trouble installing something new in
  your system.
<li> If you need to know how to do something, make clear what your
  environment is.  "I want to do <em>x</em> in Plain TeX", or "I
  want to do <em>y</em> in LaTeX running the <i>boggle</i>
  class".
<li> If something's going wrong, pretend you're
  
  
  <a href="FAQ285.html">submitting a LaTeX bug report</a>,
  and try to generate a minimum failing example.  If your example
  needs your local <i>xyzthesis</i> class, or some other resource
  not generally available, be sure to include a pointer to how the
  resource can be obtained.
<li> Be as succinct as possible.  Your helpers probably don't need to
  know <em>why</em> you're doing something, just <em>what</em> you're
  doing and where the problem is.
</ol>
