<h3>Replacing the standard classes</h3>
<p>People are forever concocting classes that replace the standard ones:
the present author produced an <i>ukart</i> class that used the
<i>sober</i> package, and a few British-specific things (such as
appear in the <i>babel</i> package's British-english
specialisation) in the 1980s, which is still occasionally used.
<p>Similar public efforts were available well back in the days of
LaTeX 2.09: a notable example, whose pleasing designs seem not to have
changed much over all that time, is the <i>ntgclass</i> bundle.
Each of the standard classes is replaced by a selection of classes,
named in Dutch, sometimes with a single numeric digit attached.  So we
have classes <i>artikel2</i>, <i>rapport1</i>, <i>boek3</i> and
<i>brief</i>.  These classes are moderately well documented in
English.
<p>The <i>koma-script</i> bundle (classes named <i>scr...</i>) are a
strong current contender.  They are under active current development,
are comprehensive in their coverage, produce good-looking output and
are well documented in both English and German.
<p>The other class currently under development is <i>memoir</i>.  This
aims to replace <i>book</i> and <i>report</i> classes directly, and
(like <i>koma-script</i>) is comprehensive in its coverage of small
issues.  <i>Memoir</i>'s documentation is very highly spoken of, and
is sometimes recommended as an introductory tutorial on typesetting.
