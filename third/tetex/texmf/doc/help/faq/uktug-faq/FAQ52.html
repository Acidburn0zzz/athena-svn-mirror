<h3>Finding new fonts</h3>
<p>A comprehensive list of Metafont fonts used to be posted to
<i>comp.fonts</i> and to <i>comp.text.tex</i>, roughly

<p>Nowadays, authors of new material in Metafont are few and far between
(and mostly designing highly specialised things with limited appeal to

scalable outline form or other (see
<a href="FAQ86.html">"choice of scalable fonts"</a>), and they
are almost all distributed under commercial terms.
