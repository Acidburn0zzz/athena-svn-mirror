<h3>Adjusting the presentation of section numbers</h3>
<p>The general issues of adjusting the appearance of section headings are
pretty complex, and are covered in 
the question on
<a href="FAQ124.html">the style of section headings</a>.
<p>However, people regularly want merely to change the way the section
number appears in the heading, and some such people don't mind writing
out a few macros.  This answer is for <em>them</em>.
<p>The way the section number is typeset is determined by the 
<code>\@seccntformat</code> command, which is given the "name" (section,
subsection, ...) of the heading, as argument.  Ordinarily, it
merely outputs the section number, and then a <code>\quad</code> of space.
Suppose you want to put a stop after every section (subsection,
subsubsection, ...) number, a trivial change may be implemented by
simple modification of the command:
<pre>
\renewcommand*{\@seccntformat}[1]{%
  \csname the#1\endcsname.\quad
}
</pre>
<p>Most people (for some reason) just want a stop after a section
number.  To do this, one must make <code>\@seccntformat</code> switch according
to its argument.  The following technique for doing the job is
slightly wasteful, but is efficient enough:
<pre>
\let\@@seccntformat\@seccntformat
\renewcommand*{\@seccntformat}[1]{%
  \expandafter\let\@tempa\expandafter
    \csname @seccntformat@#1\endcsname
  \ifx\@tempa\relax
    \expandafter\@@seccntformat
  \else
    \expandafter\@tempa
  \fi
    {#1}%
}
</pre>
which looks to see if a second-level command has been defined, and
uses it if so; otherwise it uses the original.  The second-level
command to define stops after section numbers (only) has the same
definition as the original "all levels alike" version:
<pre>
\newcommand*{\@seccntformat@section}[1]{%
  \csname the#1\endcsname.\quad
}
</pre>
<p>Note that all the command definitions of this answer are dealing in

<a href="FAQ229.html">LaTeX internal commands</a>, so the above
code should be in a package file, for preference.
