<h3>Flowing text around figures in LaTeX</h3>
<p>There are several LaTeX packages that purport to do this, but they
all have their limitations because the TeX machine isn't really
designed to solve this sort of problem.  Piet van Oostrum has
conducted a survey of the available packages; he recommends:
<p><dl>
<dt><code>floatflt</code><dd> <i>floatflt</i> is an improved version
  (for LaTeX2e) of <i>floatfig.sty</i>, and its syntax is:
<p><pre>
\begin{floatingfigure}[options]{width of figure}
   figure contents
\end{floatingfigure}
</pre>
  
<p>  There is a (more or less similar) <code>floatingtable</code> environment.
<p>  The tables or figures can be set left or right, or alternating on
  even/odd pages in a double-sided document.
<p>  The package works with the <code>multicol</code> package, but doesn't work well
  in the neighbourhood of list environments (unless you change your
  LaTeX document).
<dt><code>wrapfig</code><dd> <i>wrapfig</i> has syntax:
<p><pre>
\begin{wrapfigure}[height of figure in lines]{l|r}[overhang]{width}
  figure, caption, etc.
\end{wrapfigure}
</pre>
  
<p>  The syntax of the <code>wraptable</code> environment is similar.
<p>  Height can be omitted, in which case it will be calculated by the
  package; the package will use the greater of the specified and the
  actual width.  The <code>{l</code><em>,</em><code>r</code><em>,etc</em>.<code>}</code> parameter can also be
  specified as <code>i</code><em>(nside)</em> or <code>o</code><em>(utside)</em> for two-sided
  documents, and uppercase can be used to indicate that the picture
  should float.  The overhang allows the figure to be moved into the
  margin.  The figure or table will entered into the list of figures
  or tables if you use the <code>\caption</code> command.
<p>  The environments do not work within list environments that end
  before the figure or table has finished, but can be used in a parbox
  or minipage, and in twocolumn format.
<dt><code>picins</code><dd> <i>Picins</i> is part of a large bundle
  that allows inclusion of pictures (e.g., with
  shadow boxes, various MSDOS formats, etc.).  The command is:
<p>    <code>\parpic(width,height)(x-off,y-off)[Options][Position]{Picture}</code><br>
  
  <em>Paragraph text</em>
<p>  All parameters except the <em>Picture</em> are optional.  The picture
  can be positioned left or right, boxed with a rectangle, oval,
  shadowbox, dashed box, and a caption can be given which will be
  included in the list of figures.
<p>




<p>  Unfortunately (for those of us whose understanding of German is not
  good), the documentation is in German.  Piet van Oostrum has written
  an English summary.
