<h3><code>\@</code> and <code>@</code> in macro names</h3>
<p>Macro names containing <code>@</code> are <em>internal</em> to LaTeX, and
without special treatment just don't work in ordinary use.  An
exemplar of the problems caused is discussed in
<a href="FAQ269.html">"<code>\@</code> in vertical mode"</a>.
<p>The problems users see are caused by copying bits of a class (<code>.cls</code> file) or
package (<code>.sty</code> file) into a document, or by including a class or
package file into a LaTeX document by some means other than
<code>\documentclass</code> or <code>\usepackage</code>.  LaTeX defines internal
commands whose names contain the character <code>@</code> to
avoid clashes between its internal names and names that we would
normally use in our documents.  In order that these commands may work
at all, <code>\documentclass</code> and <code>\usepackage</code> play around with the
meaning of <code>@</code>.
<p>If you've included a file wrongly, you solve the problem by using the
correct command.
<p>If you're using a fragment of a package or class, you may well feel
confused: books such as 
<a href="FAQ22.html"><em>The LaTeX Companion</em></a> are full of
fragments of packages as examples for you to employ.
<p>For example, there's a lengthy section in <em>The Companion</em> about
<code>\@startsection</code> and how to use it to control the appearance of
section titles.  Page 15 discusses the problem; and
suggests that you make such changes in the document preamble, between
<code>\makeatletter</code> and <code>\makeatother</code>.  So the redefinition of
<code>\subsection</code> on page 26 could be:
<pre>
  \makeatletter
  \renewcommand{\subsection}{\@startsection
    {subsection}%                    % name
    ...
    {\normalfont\normalsize\itshape}}% style
  \makeatother
</pre>
<p>The alternative is to treat all these fragments as a package proper,
bundling them up into a <code>.sty</code> file and including them with
<code>\usepackage</code>.  (This approach is marginally preferable, from the
LaTeX purist's point of view.)
