<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 263</title>
</head><body>
<h3>An extra '<code>}</code>'??</h3>
You've looked at your LaTeX source and there's no sign of a misplaced
<code>}</code> on the line in question.
<p>Well, no: this is TeX's cryptic way of hinting that you've put a
<a href="FAQ230.html">fragile command</a> in a moving argument.

<p>For example, <code>\footnote</code> is fragile, and if we put that in the
moving argument of a <code>\section</code> command, as
<pre>
  \section{Mumble\footnote{%
      I couldn't think of anything better}}
</pre>
we get told
<pre>
  ! Argument of \@sect has an extra }.
</pre>
<p>The solution is usually to use a robust command in place of the one
you are using, or to force your command to be robust by prefixing it
with <code>\protect</code>, which in the above case would show as
<pre>
  \section{Mumble\protect\footnote{%
      I couldn't think of anything better}}
</pre>
<p>Note that, in some cases, simple <code>\protect</code>ion is <em>not</em> the
answer;
<a href="FAQ184.html">Footnotes in LaTeX section headings</a>
deals specifically with this case.
