<h3>Using a new language with Babel</h3>
<p><i>Babel</i> is capable of working with a large range of
languages, and a new user often wants to use a language that her
TeX installation is not set up to employ.  Simply asking Babel to
use the language, with the command
<pre>
  \usepackage[catalan]{babel}
</pre>
provokes the warning message
<pre>
Package babel Warning: No hyphenation patterns were loaded for
(babel)                the language `Catalan'
(babel)                I will use the patterns loaded for \language=0 instead.
</pre>

<p>The problem is that your TeX system doesn't know how to hyphenate
Catalan text: you need to tell it how before Babel can do its work
properly.  To do this, for LaTeX installations, one needs to change
<i>language.dat</i> (which is part of the Babel installation); it will
contain a line
<pre>
%catalan         cahyphen.tex
</pre>
which, if you remove the comment marker, is supposed to instruct
LaTeX to load Catalan hyphenation patterns when you tell it to build
a new format.
<p>Unfortunately, in many Babel distributions, the line just isn't
right - you need to check the name of the file containing the
patterns you're going to use.  As you can see, in the author's system,
the name is supposed to be <i>cahyphen.tex</i>; however the file
actually present on the system is <i>cahyph.tex</i> - fortunately,
the error should prove little more than an inconvenience (most of the
files are in better distributions anyway, but an elusive one
may be found on CTAN; if you have to retrieve
a new file, ensure that it's correctly installed, for which see
<a href="FAQ112.html">installing a new package</a>).
<p>Finally, you need to regenerate the formats used (in fact, most users
of Babel are using it in their LaTeX documents, so regenerating the
LaTeX-related formats will ordinarily be enough; however, the
author always generates the lot, regardless).
<dl>
<dt>teTeX, fpTeX<dd> To regenerate all formats, do: <br>
  <code>fmtutil --all</code>
<p>  If you're willing to think through what you're doing (this is
  <em>not</em> for the faint-hearted), you can select a sequence of
  formats and for each one, run: <br>
  <code>fmtutil --byfmt &lt;<em>formatname</em>&gt;</code><br>
  where <em><code>formatname</em></code> is something like '<code>latex</code>',
  or: <br>
  <code>fmtutil --byhyphen &lt;<em>hyphenfile</em>&gt;</code><br>
  where <em><code>hyphenfile</em></code> is the file specifying hyphenation
  to the format - usually <code>language.dat</code>
<dt>MikTeX<dd> On a <i>MikTeX</i> distribution earlier than v2.0, do: <br>
  <code>Start</code>-&gt; 
  <code>Programs</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MikTeX</code>-&gt; 
  <code>Maintenance</code>-&gt; 
  <code>Create all format files</code>

<p>  or get a DOS window and run:<br>
  <code>initexmf --dump</code>
<p>  On a <i>MikTeX</i> distribtution v2.0 or later, the whole
  procedure can be done via the GUI.  To select the new
  language, do:<br>
  <code>Start</code>-&gt; 
  <code>Programs</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MikTeX 2</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MikTeX Options</code>, and select the <code>Languages</code> tab.
  Select your language from the list, press the <code>Apply</code> button,
  and then the <code>OK</code> button.  Then select the <code>General</code>
  tab and press the <code>Update Now</code> button.
<p>  Otherwise, edit the <i>language.dat</i> file (as outlined above),
  and then run:<br>
  <code>initexmf --dump</code><br>
  just as for a pre-v2.0 system.
</dl>
<p><b><em>Caveat</em>:</b> It is (just) possible that
your TeX system may run out of "pattern memory" while generating
the new format.  Most TeX implementations have fixed-size arrays
for storing the details of hyphenation patterns, but although their
size is adjustable in most modern distributions, actually changing the
size is a fiddle.  If you <em>do</em> find you've run out of memory,
it may be worth scanning the list of languages in your
<i>language.dat</i> to see whether any could reasonably be removed.
