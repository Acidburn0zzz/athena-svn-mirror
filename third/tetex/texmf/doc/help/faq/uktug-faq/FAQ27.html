<h3>(La)TeX Tutorials, etc.</h3>
<p>Some very fine tutorials have been written, over the years.  Michael
Doob's splendid 'Gentle Introduction' to Plain TeX has been stable
for a very long time.  Another contender in the same game is from one
D. R. Wilkins, available on the web at
<a href="http://www.ntg.nl/doc/wilkins/pllong.pdf">http://www.ntg.nl/doc/wilkins/pllong.pdf</a>
<p>More dynamic is Tobias Oetiker's '(Not so) Short Introduction to
LaTeX2e', which is regularly updated, as people suggest better ways
of explaining things, etc.  The introduction has been translated into
several languages other than its original English.
<p>Harvey Greenberg's 'Simplified Introduction to LaTeX' was written
for a lecture course, and is available on CTAN (in PostScript only,
unfortunately).
<p>Peter Flynn's

<a href="http://www.silmaril.ie/downloads/documents/beginlatex.pdf">'Beginner's LaTeX'</a>
isn't yet (April 2002) complete, but is another pleasing read.  It too
started as course material.
<p>The AMS publishes a "Short Math Guide for LaTeX", which is
available (in several formats) via
<a href="http://www.ams.org/tex/short-math-guide.html">http://www.ams.org/tex/short-math-guide.html</a>
<p>Reference material is somewhat more difficult to come by.  A sterling
example is set by David Bausum's
<a href="http://www.tug.org/utilities/plain/cseq.html">list of TeX primitives</a>.
<p>Some university departments make their local documentation available
on the web.  Most straightforwardly, there's the simple translation of
existing documentation into HTML, for example the INFO
documentation of the (La)TeX installation, of which a sample is the
LaTeX documentation available at
<a href="http://www.tac.dk/cgi-bin/info2www?(latex)">http://www.tac.dk/cgi-bin/info2www?(latex)</a>
<p>More ambitiously, some departments have enthusiastic documenters who
make public record of their (La)TeX support.  For example, Tim Love
(of Cambridge University Engineering Department) maintains his
deparment's excellent pages
<a href="http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/">http://www-h.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/tpl/textprocessing/</a>
<p>Another summary by command (somewhat akin to David Basum's work for
Plain TeX) is to be found at
<a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/latex/ltx-2.html">http://www.giss.nasa.gov/latex/ltx-2.html</a>
<p>People have long argued for (La)TeX books to be made available on
the web, and 
Victor Eijkhout's excellent "TeX by Topic" (previously published
by Addison-Wesley, but long out of print) was offered in this way at
Christmas 2001.  The book is currently
available at <a href="http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/">http://www.eijkhout.net/tbt/</a>;
it's not a beginner's tutorial but it's a fine reference
(contributions are invited, and the book is well
worth the suggested contribution).
<p>Norm Walsh's "Making TeX Work" is also available (free) on the
Web, at <a href="http://makingtexwork.sourceforge.net/mtw/">http://makingtexwork.sourceforge.net/mtw/</a>; the sources
of the Web page are on CTAN.
<p>The book was an excellent resource in its day, but is now somewhat
dated; nevertheless, it still has its uses, and is a welcome addition
to the list of on-line resources.
