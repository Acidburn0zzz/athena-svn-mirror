<h3>Breaking boxes of text</h3>
<p>(La)TeX boxes may not be broken, in ordinary usage: once you've
typeset something into a box, it will stay there, and the box will
jut out beyond the side or the bottom of the page if it doesn't fit in
the typeset area.
<p>If you want a substantial portion of your text to be framed (or
coloured), the restriction starts to seem a real imposition.
Fortunately, there are ways around the problem.
<p>The <i>framed</i> package provides <code>framed</code> and
<code>shaded</code> environments; both put their content into
something which looks like a framed (or coloured) box, but which
breaks as necessary at page end.  The environments "lose" footnotes,
marginpars and head-line entries, and will not work with
<i>multicol</i> or other column-balancing macros.
<p>The <i>boites</i> package provides a <code>breakbox</code>
environment; examples of its use may be found in the distribution, and
the package's <i>README</i> file contains terse documentation.  The
environments may be nested, and may appear inside
<code>multicols</code> environments; however, floats, footnotes and
marginpars will be lost.
<p>For Plain TeX users, the facilities of the
<i>backgrnd</i> package may be useful; this package subverts the
output routine to provide vertical bars to mark text, and the macros
are clearly marked to show where coloured backgrounds may be
introduced (this requires <i>shade</i>, which is distributed as tex
macros and device-independent Metafont for the shading).  The author of
<i>backgrnd</i> claims that the package works with LaTeX 2.09, but
there are reasons to suspect that it may be unstable working with
current LaTeX.
