<h3>Learning to write LaTeX classes and packages</h3>
<p>There's nothing particularly magic about the commands you use when
writing a package, so you can simply bundle up a set of LaTeX
<code>\(re)newcommand</code> and <code>\(re)newenvironment</code> commands, put them in
a file <i>package.sty</i> and you have a package.
<p>However, any but the most trivial package will require rather more
sophistication.  Some details of LaTeX commands for the job are to
be found in 'LaTeX2e for class and package writers'
(<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/doc/html/clsguide">http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/doc/html/clsguide</a>:
the LaTeX source of this document appears in the LaTeX distribution).
Beyond this, a good knowledge of TeX itself is valuable.  With such
knowledge it is possible to use the documented source of LaTeX as
reference material (dedicated authors will acquaint themselves with the
source as a matter of course).  A complete set of the documented
source of LaTeX may be prepared by processing the file
<i>source2e.tex</i> in the LaTeX distribution.
<p>Writing good classes is not easy; it's a good idea to read some
established ones (<i>classes.dtx</i>, for example, produces the
standard classes other than <i>letter</i>, and may itself be
formatted with LaTeX).  Classes that are not part of the
distribution are commonly based on ones that are, and start by loading
the standard class with <code>\LoadClass</code> - an example of this
technique may be seen in <i>ltxguide.cls</i>
