<h3>What is LaTeX2e?</h3>
<p>Lamport's last version of LaTeX (LaTeX 2.09, last updated in 1992)
was superseded in 1994 by a new version (LaTeX2e) written by
<a href="FAQ276.html">the LaTeX team</a>.
LaTeX2e is now the only readily-available version of
LaTeX, and draws together several threads of LaTeX development
from the later days of LaTeX 2.09.
<p>LaTeX2e has several enhancements over LaTeX 2.09, but they were all
rather minor, with a view to continuity and stability rather than the
"big push" that some had expected from the team.  LaTeX2e
continues to this day to offer a compatibility mode in which most
files prepared for use with LaTeX 2.09 will run (albeit with somewhat
reduced performance).  Differences between LaTeX2e and LaTeX 2.09 are
outlined in a series of 'guide' files that are available in every
LaTeX distribution; the most important of these files is available
on the Web as 
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/doc/html/usrguide/">http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex/doc/html/usrguide/</a>
and outlines the differences as seen by the ordinary writer of
documents and of simple macros.
