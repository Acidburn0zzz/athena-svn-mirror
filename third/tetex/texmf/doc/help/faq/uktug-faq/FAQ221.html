<h3>How to break the 9-argument limit</h3>
<p>If you think about it, you will realise that Knuth's command
definition syntax:
<pre>
  \def\blah#1#2 ... #9{&lt;macro body&gt;}
</pre>
is intrinsically limited to just 9 arguments.  There's no direct way
round this: how would you express a 10th argument? - and ensure that
the syntax didn't gobble some other valid usage?
<p>If you really must have more than 9 arguments, the way to go is:
<pre>
  \def\blah#1#2 ... #9{%
    \def\ArgI{{#1}}%
    \def\ArgII{{#2}}%
    ...
    \def\ArgIX{{#9}}%
    \BlahRelay
  }
  \def\BlahRelay#1#2#3{%
    % arguments 1-9 are now in
    %   \ArgI-\ArgIX
    % arguments 10-12 are in
    %   #1-#3
    &lt;macro body&gt;%
  }
</pre>
This technique is easily extendible by concert pianists of the TeX
keyboard, but is really hard to recommend.
<p>LaTeX users have the small convenience of merely giving a number of
arguments in the <code>\newcommand</code> that defines each part of the
relaying mechanism: Knuth's restriction applies to <code>\newcommand</code>
just as it does to <code>\def</code>.  However, LaTeX users also have the
way out of such barbarous command syntax: the <i>keyval</i>
package.  With <i>keyval</i>, and a bit of programming, one can
write really quite sophisticated commands, whose invocation might look
like:
<pre>
  \flowerinstance{species=Primula veris,
    family=Primulaceae,
    location=Coldham's Common,
    locationtype=Common grazing land,
    date=1995/04/24,
    numplants=50,
    soiltype=alkaline
  }
</pre>
The merit of such verbosity is that it is self-explanatory: the typist
doesn't have to remember that argument twelve is <code>soiltype</code>, and so
on: the commands may be copied from field notes quickly and
accurately.
