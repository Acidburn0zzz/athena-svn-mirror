<h3>Proof environment</h3>
<p>It has long been thought impossible to make a <code>proof</code>
environment which automatically includes an 'end-of-proof' symbol.
Some proofs end in displayed maths; others do not.  If the input file
contains

<code>...\] \end{proof}</code> then LaTeX finishes off the displayed maths and gets
ready for a new line before it reads any instructions connected with
ending the proof, so the code is very tricky.  You <em>can</em> insert
the symbol by hand, but the <i>ntheorem</i> package now solves the
problem for LaTeX users: it does indeed provide an automatic way of
signalling the end of a proof.
<p>The AMSLaTeX package <i>amsthm</i> also provides a
<code>proof</code> environment that does the job; though you need to
insert a <code>\qedhere</code> command if the proof ends with a displayed
equation:
<pre>
\begin{proof}
 text...
 \begin{equation*}
  maths... \tag*{\qedhere}
 \end{equation*}
\end{proof}
</pre>
The <code>\tag*{\qedhere}</code> construction may be used in any of AMSLaTeX's
numbering environments.
