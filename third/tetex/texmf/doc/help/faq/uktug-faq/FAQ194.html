<h3>Makefiles for LaTeX documents</h3>
<p>LaTeX is a tricky beast for running <i>make</i> on: the need to
instruct LaTeX to run several times for essentially different
reasons (for example, "get the table of contents stable", "get the
labels stable", "add the bibliography", "add the index") is
actually rather difficult to express in the 'ordinary' sort of
dependency graph that one constructs for <i>make</i>.
<p>For this reason, the only <i>make</i>-like package on CTAN
(for a long time) was <i>latexmk</i>, which is a <i>Perl</i>
script that analyses your LaTeX source for its dependencies, runs
BibTeX or <i>makeindex</i> as and when it notices that those
programs' input (parts of the <code>.aux</code> file, or the <code>.idx</code> file,
respectively) has changed, and so on.  <i>Latexmk</i> is a fine
solution (and was used in generating printable versions of these
FAQs for a long time); it has recently been upgraded and has
many bells and whistles that allow it to operate as if it were a poor
man's WYSIWYG system.
<p>The 
<a href="FAQ16.html"><i>texinfo</i> system</a> comes with a
utility called <i>texi2dvi</i>, which is capable of "converting"
either LaTeX or <i>texinfo</i> files into DVI (or into
PDF, using PDFTeX).
<p>A later contribution is the bundle <i>latexmake</i>, which
offers a set of <i>make</i> rules that invoke <i>texi2dvi</i>
as necessary.
<p>The curious may examine the rules employed to run the present
FAQ through LaTeX: we don't present them as a complete
solution, but some of the tricks employed are surely re-usable.
