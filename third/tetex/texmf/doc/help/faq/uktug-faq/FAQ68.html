<h3>Conversion from (La)TeX to plain ASCII</h3>
<p>The aim here is to emulate the Unix <i>nroff</i>, which formats
text as best it can for the screen, from the same
input as the Unix typesetting program <i>troff</i>.
<p>Converting DVI to plain text is the basis of many of these
techniques; sometimes the simple conversion provides a good enough
response.  Options are:
<ul>
<li> <i>dvi2tty</i> (one of the earliest)
<li> <i>crudetype</i>
<li> <i>catdvi</i>, which is also capable of generating Latin-1
  or UTF-8 encoded output.  <i>Catdvi</i> was conceived as
  a replacement for <i>dvi2tty</i>, but can't (quite) be
  recommended as a complete replacement yet.
</ul>
<p>Ralph Droms provides a <i>txt</i> bundle of things in support of
ASCII generation,
but it doesn't do a good job with tables and mathematics.  An
alternative is the <i>screen</i> package.
<p>Another possibility is to
use the LaTeX-to-ASCII conversion program, <i>l2a</i>,
although this is really more of a de-TeXing program.
<p>The canonical de-TeXing program is <i>detex</i>, which removes
all comments and control sequences 
from its input before writing it to its output.  Its original purpose
was to prepare input for a dumb spelling checker, and it's only usable
for preparing useful ASCII versions of a document in highly
restricted circumstances.
<p><i>Tex2mail</i> is slightly more than a de-TeXer - it's a Perl
script that converts TeX files into
plain text files, expanding various mathematical symbols
(sums, products, integrals, sub/superscripts, fractions, square
roots, ...) into "ASCII art" that spreads over
multiple lines if necessary. The result is more readable to human
beings than the flat-style TeX code.
<p>Another significant possibility is to use one of the


<a href="FAQ70.html">HTML-generation solutions</a>,
and then to use a browser such as <i>lynx</i> to dump the resulting
HTML as plain text.
