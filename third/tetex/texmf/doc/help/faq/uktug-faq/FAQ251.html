<h3>No line here to end</h3>
<p>The error
<pre>
! LaTeX Error: There's no line here to end.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.

comes in reaction to you giving LaTeX a <code>\</code><code>\</code> command at a time
when it's not expecting it.  The commonest case is where you've
decided you want the label of a list item to be on a line of its own,
so you've written (for example):
<pre>
  \begin{description}
  \item[Very long label] \\
    Text...
  \end{description}
</pre>
<code>\</code><code>\</code> is actually a rather bad command to use in this case (even if
it worked), since it would force the 'paragraph' that's made up of the
text of the item to terminate a line which has nothing on it but the
label.  This would lead to an "<code>Underfull \hbox</code>" warning message
(usually with 'infinite' badness of 10000); while this message doesn't
do any actual harm other than slowing down your LaTeX run, any
message that doesn't convey any information distracts for no useful
purpose.
<p>The proper solution to the problem is to write a new sort of
<code>description</code> environment, that does just what you're after.  (The

<a href="FAQ22.html">LaTeX Companion</a> offers a
rather wide selection of variants of these things.)
<p>The quick-and-easy solution, which avoids the warning, is to write:
<pre>
  \begin{description}
  \item[Very long label] \hspace*{\fill} \\
    Text...
  \end{description}
</pre>
which fills out the under-full line before forcing its closure.  The
<i>expdlist</i> package provides the same functionality with its
<code>\breaklabel</code> command, and <i>mdwlist</i> provides it via its
<code>\desclabelstyle</code> command.
<p>The other common occasion for the message is when you're using the
<code>center</code> (or <code>flushleft</code> or \environment{flushright})
environment, and have decided you need extra separation between lines
in the environment:
<pre>
  \begin{center}
    First (heading) line\\
    \\
    body of the centred text...
  \end{center}
</pre>
<p>The solution here is plain: use the <code>\</code><code>\</code> command in the way it's
supposed to be used, to provide more than just a single line break
space.  <code>\</code><code>\</code> takes an optional argument, which specifies how much
extra space to add; the required effect in the text above can be had
by saying:
<pre>
  \begin{center}
    First (heading) line\\[\baselineskip]
    body of the centred text...
  \end{center}
</pre>
