<h3>URLs in BibTeX bibliographies</h3>
<p>There is no citation type for URLs, <em>per se</em>, in the
standard BibTeX styles, though Oren Patashnik (the author of
BibTeX) is considering developing one such for use with the
long-awaited BibTeX version 1.0.
<p>The actual information that need be available in a citation of an
URL is discussed at some length in the publicly available
on-line 

<a href="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/standard/690-2e.htm">extracts of ISO 690-2</a>;
the techniques below do <em>not</em> satisfy all the requirements of
ISO 690-2, but they offer a solution that is at least
available to users of today's tools.
<p>Until the new version arrives, the simplest technique is to use the
<code>howpublished</code> field of the standard styles' <code>@misc</code> function.  Of
course, the strictures

about <a href="FAQ153.html">typesetting URLs</a>
 still apply, so the entry will look like:
<pre>
  @misc{...,
    ...,
    howpublished = "\url{http://...}"
  }
</pre>
<p>Another possibility is that some conventionally-published paper,
technical report (or even book) is also available on the Web.  In such
cases, a useful technique is something like:
<pre>
  @techreport{...,
    ...,
    note = "Also available as \url{http://...}"
  }
</pre>
<p>There is good reason to use the <i>url</i> or <i>hyperref</i>
packages in this context, since (by default) the <code>\url</code> command
ignores spaces in its argument.  BibTeX has a habit of splitting
lines it considers excessively long, and if there are no space
characters for it to use as 'natural' breakpoints, BibTeX will
insert a comment ('<code>%</code>') character ... which
is an acceptable character in an URL, so that <code>\url</code> will
typeset it.  If you're using <i>url</i>, the way around the problem
is to insert odd spaces inside the URL itself in the <code>.bib</code>
file, to enable BibTeX to make reasonable decisions about breaking
the line.  Note that the version of <code>\url</code> that comes with recent
versions of the <i>hyperref</i> package doesn't suffer from the
'<code>%</code>-end of line' problem: <i>hyperref</i>
spots the problem, and suppresses the unwanted characters.
<p>A possible alternative approach is to use the <i>harvard</i>
package (if its citation styles are otherwise satisfactory for you).
<i>Harvard</i> bibliography styles all include a "<code>url</code>" field in
their specification; however, the typesetting offered is somewhat
feeble (though it does recognise and use <i>LaTeX2HTML</i> macros
if they are available, to create hyperlinks).
