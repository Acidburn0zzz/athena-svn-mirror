<h3>BibTeX doesn't understand lists of names</h3>
<p>BibTeX has a strict syntax for lists of authors' (or editors')
names in the BibTeX data file; if you write the list of names in a
"natural"-seeming way, the chances are you will confuse BibTeX,
and the output produced will be quite different from what you had
hoped.
<p>Names should be expressed in one of the forms
<pre>
  First Last
  Last, First
  Last, Suffix, First
</pre>
and lists of names should be separated with "<code>and</code>".
For example:
<pre>
AUTHOR = {Fred Q. Bloggs, John P. Doe \&amp;
          Robin Fairbairns}
</pre>
falls foul of two of the above rules: a syntactically significant
comma appears in an incorrect place, and <code>\&amp;</code> is being used as a
name separator.  The output of the above might be something like:
<pre>
John P. Doe \&amp; Robin Fairbairns Fred Q. Bloggs
</pre>
because "John P. Doe &amp; Robin Fairbairns" has become the 'first name',
while "Fred Q. Bloggs" has become the 'last name' of a single
person.  The example should have been written:
<pre>
AUTHOR = {Fred Q. Bloggs and John P. Doe and
          Robin Fairbairns}
</pre>
<p>Some bibliography styles implement clever acrobatics with very long
author lists.  You can force truncation by using the pseudo-name
"<code>others</code>", which will usually translate to something like
"<em>et al</em>" in the typeset output.  So, if Mr. Bloggs wanted to
distract attention from his co-authors, he would write:
<pre>
AUTHOR = {Fred Q. Bloggs and others}
</pre>
