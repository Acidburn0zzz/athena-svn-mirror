<h3>Other "document font" sizes?</h3>
<p>The LaTeX standard classes have a concept of a (base) "document
font" size; this size is the basis on which other font sizes (those
from <code>\tiny</code> to <code>\Huge</code>) are determined.  The classes are designed
on the assumption that they won't be used with sizes other than the
set that LaTeX offers by default (10-12pt), but people regularly
find they need other sizes.  The proper response to such a requirement
is to produce a new design for the document, but many people don't
fancy doing that.
<p>Pragmatists, therefore, will tend to go for the classes in the
<i>extsizes</i> bundle.  This bundle offers
"extended" versions of the article, report, book and letter classes,
at sizes of 8, 9, 14, 17 and 20pt as well as the standard 10-12pt.
Since little has been done to these classes other than to adjust font
sizes and things directly related to them, they won't be optimal -
but they're certainly practical.
