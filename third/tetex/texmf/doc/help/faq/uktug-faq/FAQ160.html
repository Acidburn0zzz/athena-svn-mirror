<h3>The format of the Table of Contents, etc.</h3>
<p>The formats of entries in the table of contents (TOC) are
controlled by a number of internal commands (discussed in section 2.4
of <em>The LaTeX Companion</em> - see

<a href="FAQ22.html">TeX books</a>).
The commands <code>\@pnumwidth</code>, <code>\@tocrmarg</code> and <code>\@dotsep</code> control
the space for page numbers, the indentation of the right-hand margin,
and the seperation of the dots in the dotted leaders, respectively.
The series
of commands named <code>\l@xxx</code>, where <code>xxx</code> is the name of a sectional heading
(such as <code>chapter</code> or <code>section</code>, ...) control the layout of the
corresponding heading, including the space for section numbers.
All these internal commands may be individually redefined
to give the effect that you want.
<p>Alternatively, the package <i>tocloft</i> 
provides a set of user-level 
commands that may be used to change the TOC formatting.  Since
exactly the same mechanisms are used for the List of Figures and List
of Tables, the layout of these sections may be controlled in the same way.
