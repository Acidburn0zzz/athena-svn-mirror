<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 19</title>

<h3>Reading (La)TeX files</h3>
<p>So you've been sent a TeX file: what are you going to do with it?
Well, the good news is that TeX systems are available, free, for
most sorts of computer; the bad news is that you need a pretty
complete TeX system even to read a single file, and complete TeX
systems are pretty large.
<p>TeX is a typesetting system that arose from a publishing project (see
"<a href="FAQ1.html">what is TeX</a>"),
and its basic source is available free from its author.  However, at
its root, it is <em>just</em> a typesetting engine: even to view or to
print the typeset output, you will need anciliary programs.  In short,
you need a TeX <em>distribution</em> - a collection of
TeX-related programs tailored to your operating system: for details
of the sorts of things that are available, see

"<a href="FAQ54.html">TeX distributions</a>"
or

"<a href="FAQ56.html">commercial TeX distributions</a>".
<p>But beware - TeX makes no attempt to look like the sort of
WYSIWYG system you're probably used to (see

"<a href="FAQ20.html">why is TeX not WYSIWYG</a>"):
while many modern versions of TeX have a compile-view cycle that
rivals the best commercial word processors in its responsiveness, what
you type is usually <em>mark-up</em>, which typically defines a logical
(rather than a visual) view of what you want typeset.
<p>However, in this context markup proves to be a blessing in disguise: a
good proportion of most TeX documents is immediately readable in an
ordinary text editor.  So, while you need to install a considerable
system to attain the full benefits of the TeX document that you
were sent, the chances are you can understand quite a bit of it with
nothing more than the ordinary tools you already have on your computer.
