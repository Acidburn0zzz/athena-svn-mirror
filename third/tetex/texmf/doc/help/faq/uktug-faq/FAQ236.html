<h3>A command with two optional arguments</h3>
<p>
If you've already read 
"<a href="FAQ221.html">breaking the 9-argument limit</a>"
you can probably guess the solution to this problem: command relaying.
<p>LaTeX allows commands with a single optional argument thus:
<pre>
  \newcommand{\blah}[1][Default]{...}
</pre>
<p>You may legally call such a command either with its optional argument
present, as
<code>\blah[nonDefault]</code> or as <code>\blah</code>; in the latter case, the
code of <code>\blah</code> will have an argument of <code>Default</code>.
<p>To define a command with two optional arguments, we use the relaying
technique, as follows:
<pre>
  \newcommand{\blah}[1][Default1]{%
    \def\ArgI{{#1}}%
    \BlahRelay
  }
  \newcommand\BlahRelay[1][Default2]{%
    % the first optional argument is now in
    %   \ArgI
    % the second is in #1
    ...%
  }
</pre>
Of course, <code>\BlahRelay</code> may have as many mandatory arguments as are
allowed, after allowance for the one taken up with its own
optional argument - that is, 8.
<p>A command with two optional arguments strains the limit of what's
sensible: obviously you can extend the technique to provide as many
optional arguments as your fevered imagination can summon.  However,
see the comments on the use of the <i>keyval</i> package in 


"<a href="FAQ221.html">breaking the 9-argument limit</a>",
which offer an alternative way forward.
<p>An alternative approach is offered by Scott Pakin's
<i>newcommand</i> program, which takes a command name and a
definition of a set of command arguments (in a fairly
readily-understood language), and emits (La)TeX macros which enable
the command to be defined.  The command requires that a
<i>python</i> system be installed on your computer.
