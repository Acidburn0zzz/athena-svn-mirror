<h3>How should I pronounce "TeX"?</h3>
<p>The 'X' stands for the lower case Greek letter

Chi (the upper-case Greek letter doesn't look in the least like a
letter "X")
and is pronounced by English-speakers either a bit like the 'ch' in
the Scots word 'loch' ([x] in the IPA) or like 'k'.  It definitely is
not pronounced 'ks'.
