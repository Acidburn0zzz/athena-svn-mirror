<h3>What is ConTeXt?</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.pragma-ade.com/">ConTeXt</a> is a macro package
developed by Hans Hagen, originally to
serve the needs of the Dutch firm, Pragma.  It was designed with the
same general-purpose aims as LaTeX, but (being younger) reflects
much more recent thinking about the structure of markup, etc.  In
particular, ConTeXt can customise its markup to an
author's language (customising modules for Dutch, English and German
are provided, at present).
<p>ConTeXt is well integrated, in all of its structure,
with the needs of hypertext markup, and in particular with the
facilities offered by 

<a href="FAQ279.html">PDFTeX</a>.
The default installation employs a
version of TeX built with both the PDFTeX and
<a href="FAQ278.html">e-TeX</a>
extensions, and makes good use of both.
<p>ConTeXt doesn't yet have quite such a large developer community as
does LaTeX, but those developers who are active seem to have
prodigious energy.
