<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 283</title>

<h3>You don't understand the answer</h3>
<p>While the FAQ maintainers don't offer a 'help' service, they're
very keen that you understand the answers they've already written.
They're (almost) written "in a vacuum", to provide something to
cover a set of questions that have arisen; it's always possible that
they're written in a way that a novice won't understand them.
<p>Which is where you can help the community.  Mail the 
<a href="mailto:faq@tex.ac.uk">maintainers</a> to report the answer
that you find unclear.  Time permitting (the team is small and all its
members are busy), we'll try and clarify the answer.  This way, with a
bit of luck, we can together improve the value of this resource to the
whole community.
<p>(We need hardly say that we look forward to hearing from none of you:
but we're not so arrogant as to be confident that we won't!)
