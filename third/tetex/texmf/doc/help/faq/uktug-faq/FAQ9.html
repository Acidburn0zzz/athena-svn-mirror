<h3>How should I pronounce "LaTeX(2e)"?</h3>

<p>Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it 'Lay TeX' or perhaps 'Lah TeX' (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
<a href="FAQ2.html">the rules for TeX</a>).  It is definitely
<em>not</em> to be pronounced in the same way as the rubber-tree gum.
<p>The 'epsilon' in 'LaTeX2e' is supposed to be suggestive of a small
improvement over the old LaTeX 2.09.  Nevertheless, most people
pronounce the name as 'LaTeX-two-ee'.
