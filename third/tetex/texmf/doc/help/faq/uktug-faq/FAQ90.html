<h3>Graphics in <i>dvips</i></h3>
<p><i>Dvips</i>, as originally conceived, can only import a single
graphics format: 
<a href="FAQ45.html">encapsulated PostScript</a> (<code>.eps</code> files).
<i>Dvips</i> also deals with the slightly eccentric <code>.eps</code> that is
created by <a href="FAQ4.html">MetaPost</a>.
<p>Apart from the fact that a depressing proportion of drawing
applications produce corrupt EPS when asked for such output,
this is pretty satisfactory for vector graphics work.
<p>To include bitmap graphics, you need some means of converting them to
PostScript; in fact many standard image manipulators (such as
<i>ImageMagick</i>'s <i>convert</i>) make a good job of
creating EPS files.  (Though <i>Unix</i> users should
beware of <i>xv</i>'s claims: it has a tendency to downsample your
bitmap to your screen resolution.)
<p>Special purpose applications <i>jpeg2ps</i> (which converts
JPEG files using PostScript level 2 functionality) and
<i>bmeps</i> (which converts both JPEG and PNG
files) are also considered "good bets".  <i>Bmeps</i> comes with
patches to produce your own version of <i>dvips</i> that can cope
with JPEG and PNG direct, using <i>bmeps</i>'s
conversion library.
