<h3>TeX User Groups</h3>
<p>There has been a TeX User Group since very near the time TeX
first appeared.  That first group, TUG, is still active and its
journal <em>TUGboat</em> continues in publication (4 issues a year)
with articles about TeX, Metafont and related technologies, and about
document design, processing and production.  TUG holds a yearly
conference, whose proceedings are published in <em>TUGboat</em>.
<p>TUG's web site is a valuable resource for all sorts of
TeX-related matters, such as details of TeX software, and lists
of TeX vendors and TeX consultants.  Back articles from
<em>TUGboat</em> are slowly (subject to copyright issues, etc.)
making their way to the site, too.
<p>Some time ago, TUG established a "technical council", whose
task was to oversee the development of TeXnical projects.  Most
such projects nowadays go on their way without any support from
TUG, but TUG's web site lists its

<a href="http://www.tug.org/twg.html">Technical Working Groups (TWGs)</a>.
<p>TUG has a reasonable claim to be considered a world-wide
organisation, but there are many national and regional user groups,
too; TUG's web site maintains a list of

<a href="http://www.tug.org/lugs.html">"local user groups" (LUGs)</a>.
