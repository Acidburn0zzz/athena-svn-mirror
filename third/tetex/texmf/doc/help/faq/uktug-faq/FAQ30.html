<h3>Metafont and MetaPost Tutorials</h3>
<p>Unfortunately there appear to be no tutorials on how to use Metafont (the
language): we only have Knuth's book.  There are, though, a couple of
articles on how to run both Metafont and MetaPost (the programs).
<p>Geoffrey Tobin's <em>Metafont for Beginners</em> (see
<a href="FAQ79.html">using Metafont</a>) describes how the Metafont system
works and how to avoid some of the potential pitfalls.
<p>Peter Wilson's <em>Some Experiences in Running Metafont and MetaPost</em>
offers the benefit of Peter's experience (he has designed a number of
'historical' fonts using Metafont). On the Metafont side the article
is more geared towards testing and installing new Metafont fonts than on
the system, while on the other side it describes how to use MetaPost 
illustrations in LaTeX and PDFLaTeX documents, with an emphasis on
how to use appropriate fonts for any text or mathematics.
<p>Hans Hagen (of ConTeXt fame) offers a MetaPost tutorial called
MetaFun (which admittedly concentrates on the use of MetaPost with in ConTeXt).  It may be found on his company's
<a href="http://www.pragma-ade.com/metapost.htm">MetaPost page</a>.
