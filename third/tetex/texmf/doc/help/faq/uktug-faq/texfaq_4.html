<H1><A NAME="SEC4">Acquiring the Software</A></H1>


<H2><A NAME="QU34">Repositories of TeX material</A></H2>

<P>
To aid the archiving and retrieval of of TeX-related files, a
TUG working group developed the Comprehensive TeX Archive
Network (CTAN).  Each CTAN site has identical material,
and maintains authoritative versions of its material.  These
collections are extensive; in particular, almost everything mentioned
in this article is archived at the CTAN sites, even if its
location isn't explicitly stated.

<P>
The CTAN sites are currently <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de"><TT>ftp.dante.de</TT></A>
(<A HREF="ftp://129.206.100.192"><TT>129.206.100.192</TT></A>), <A HREF="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk"><TT>ftp.tex.ac.uk</TT></A> (<A HREF="ftp://128.232.1.87"><TT>128.232.1.87</TT></A>) and
<A HREF="ftp://ctan.tug.org"><TT>ctan.tug.org</TT></A> (<A HREF="ftp://158.121.106.16"><TT>158.121.106.16</TT></A>).
The organisation of TeX files on all
these sites is identical and starts at
<TT>tex-archive/</TT>.  To reduce network load, please use the CTAN site
or mirror closest to you.  A complete and current list of CTAN sites
and known mirrors can be obtained by using the <I>finger</I> utility on
`user' <SAMP>ctan@ftp.tex.ac.uk</SAMP>, <SAMP>ctan@ftp.dante.de</SAMP> or
<SAMP>ctan@tug.cs.umb.edu</SAMP>; it is
also available as file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/CTAN.sites"><TT>CTAN.sites</TT></A>

<P>
To find software at a CTAN site, use anonymous <CODE>ftp</CODE> to the host,
and then execute the command `<CODE>quote site index &lt;term&gt;</CODE>' (see
<A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU25">finding files</A> for details).

<P>
The email server
<A HREF="mailto://ftpmail@ftp.dante.de"><TT>ftpmail@ftp.dante.de</TT></A> provides an <CODE>ftp</CODE>-like interface through
mail.  Send a message containing just the line `<CODE>help</CODE>' to your
nearest server for details of use.

<P>
Users on BITNET may access anonymous <CODE>ftp</CODE> for some files 
indirectly by sending mail to <A HREF="mailto://BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET"><TT>BITFTP@PUCC.BITNET</TT></A>.   Send a
message containing the line `<CODE>help</CODE>' to this address for more
information.
There is also the DECUS TeX collection of
material for VMS, Unix, MS-DOS, and the Macintosh.
It is available via anonymous <CODE>ftp</CODE> from
<A HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu"><TT>wuarchive.wustl.edu</TT></A> (128.252.135.4) in
<TT>decus/tex/</TT>.  It can also be obtained from the DECUS Library
(reference number VS0058) in the US, or through your DECUS office
outside of the US. To contact the DECUS Library, send mail or telephone:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  DECUS<BR>
  LIBRARY ORDER PROCESSING<BR>
  334 South Street, SHR3-1/T25<BR>
  Shrewsbury, MA 01545-4195<BR>

  Tel: 800-DECUS55 (within the USA, for information)<BR>
  Fax: (+1) 508-841-3373 (for inquiries)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
or send electronic mail for information to the DECUS TeX Collection
Editor, Ted Nieland (<SAMP>nieland@ted.hcst.com</SAMP>).


<P>
Finally, of course, the TeX user who has no access to any sort of
network may buy a copy of the archive on CD-ROM (see
<A HREF="texfaq_4.html#QU37">TeX CD-ROMs</A>).


<H2><A NAME="QU35">Contributing a file to the archives</A></H2>

<P>
Use anonymous <CODE>ftp</CODE> to any CTAN archive
(see <A HREF="texfaq_4.html#QU34">sources of software</A>) and retrieve
the file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/README.uploads"><TT>README.uploads</TT></A> in the root directory. It contains
instructions for uploading files and notifying the appropriate people
for that site.

<P>
If you cannot use <CODE>ftp</CODE>, mail your contribution to
<A HREF="mailto://ctan@urz.Uni-Heidelberg.de"><TT>ctan@urz.Uni-Heidelberg.de</TT></A> and it will be passed along.  You will make
everyone's life easier if you choose a descriptive and unique name for
your submission, so it's probably a good idea to check that your style
file's name is not already in use by means of the
`<CODE>site index</CODE>'
command (<A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU25">finding files in the archives</A>).


<H2><A NAME="QU36">Finding new fonts</A></H2>

<P>
A comprehensive list of METAFONT fonts is posted to
<SAMP>comp.fonts</SAMP> and to <SAMP>comp.text.tex</SAMP>, roughly
every six weeks, by Lee Quin (<SAMP>lee@sq.sq.com</SAMP>); it is available
as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/metafont-list"><TT>info/metafont-list</TT></A>

<P>
The list contains details both of commercial fonts and of fonts
available via anonymous <CODE>ftp</CODE>. Most of the fonts are available via
anonymous <CODE>ftp</CODE> from the CTAN archives
(see <A HREF="texfaq_4.html#QU34">sources of software</A>).


<H2><A NAME="QU37">TeX CD-ROMs</A></H2>

<P>
If you don't have access to the Internet, there are obvious
attractions to TeX collections on a CD-ROM.  Even those with net
access will find large quantities of TeX-related files to hand a
great convenience.


<P>
Ready-to-run TeX systems on CD-ROM are available:
<UL>
<LI> A consortium of User Groups (notably TUG,
  UK TUG and GUTenberg) distribute the
  TeX Live CD-ROM, now in its third edition.  All members of
  several User Groups are receiving copies, and additional copies may
  be purchased, for example, from UK TUG for &pound;25,
  including an edition of Baskerville which serves as a manual.

<P>
  On-line details of TeX Live are available at
  <A HREF="http://www.tug.org/texlive.html"><TT>http://www.tug.org/texlive.html</TT></A>
<LI> The Dutch TeX Users Group (NTG) publish the whole
  4AllTeX workbench on a 2-CD-ROM set packed with all the
  MS-DOS TeX software, macros and fonts you can want. It is
  available from NTG direct (see
  <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU17">user groups</A>), from TUG for
  $40 and from UK TUG for &pound;30 (a manual is
  included). It is a useful resource for anyone to browse, not just
  for MS-DOS users.
</UL>

<P>
An alternative to the ready-to-run system is the CTAN archive
snapshot; in general one would expect that such systems would be
harder to use, but that the volume of resources offered would balance
this extra inconvenience.

<P>
Walnut Creek CDROM provide a two-disc CD-ROM set, holding
1000Mb of TeX-related material.  Information about the CD-ROM is
available at <A HREF="http://www.cdrom.com/titles/prog/tex.html"><TT>http://www.cdrom.com/titles/prog/tex.html</TT></A>, which also
has a link to an ordering page.  Walnut Creek's address, etc., are:

Walnut Creek (who run one of the major CTAN mirrors) are
rumoured to be producing a new release of their disc set in 1997.

<P>
Prime Time Freeware produced <EM>TeXcetera</EM> 1.1 in July 1994,
which was a snapshot of CTAN taken in June 1994.  Regular
updates were planned (but have not apparently been forthcoming).
The material is all compressed in ZIP format to fit it all on
one CD, and to avoid the limitations of the ISO 9660
file system directory. You can buy the CD from:

or from many CD-ROM resellers, or the
  <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU16">TUG</A> office.
Price will be around $60. Please note that PTF is not a big
commercial firm, and is a good friend of the TeX community.
