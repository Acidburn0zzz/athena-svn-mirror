<h3>How to do bold-tt or bold-sc</h3>
<p>LaTeX, as delivered, offers no means of handling bold "teletype"
or small-caps fonts.  There's a practical reason for this (Knuth never
designed such fonts), but there are typographical considerations too
(the "medium weight" <code>cmtt</code> font is already pretty bold (by
comparison with other fixed-width fonts), and bold small-caps is not
popular with many professional typographers).
<p>There's a set of "extra" Metafont files on CTAN that provide bold
versions of both <code>cmtt</code> and <code>cmcsc</code> (the small caps font).  With
modern TeX distributions, one may bring these fonts into use simply

by placing them in an 
<a href="FAQ113.html">appropriate place in the <em>texmf</em> tree</a>;
TeX (and friends) will automatically build whatever font files they
need when you first make reference to them.  There's a jiffy package
<i>bold-extra</i> that builds the necessary font data structures
so that you can use the fonts within LaTeX.
<p>If you need to use Type 1 fonts, you can't proceed with Knuth-style
fonts, since there are no Type 1 versions of the <i>mf-extra</i>
set.  However, commercial fixed-width fonts (including the default
<i>Courier</i>) almost always come with a bold variant, so that's
not a problem.  Furthermore 

<a href="FAQ82.html">PSNFSS</a> typically provides
"faked" small caps fonts, and has no compunctions about providing
them in a bold form.
