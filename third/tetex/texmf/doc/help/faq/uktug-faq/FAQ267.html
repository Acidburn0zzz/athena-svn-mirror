<h3>Improper <code>\hyphenation</code> will be flushed</h3>
<p>For example
<pre>
! Improper \hyphenation will be flushed.
\'#1-&gt;{
       \accent 19 #1}
&lt;*&gt; \hyphenation{Ji-m\'e
                        -nez}
</pre>
(in Plain TeX) or
<pre>
! Improper \hyphenation will be flushed.
\leavevmode -&gt;\unhbox 
                      \voidb@x 
&lt;*&gt; \hyphenation{Ji-m\'e
                        -nez}
</pre>
in LaTeX.
<p>As mentioned in <a href="FAQ197.html">"hyphenation failures"</a>,
words with accents in them may not be hyphenated.  As a result, any
such word is deemed improper in a <code>\hyphenation</code> command.
<p>The solution is to use a font that contains the character in question,
and to express the <code>\hyphenation</code> command in terms of that
character; this "hides" the accent from the hyphenation mechanisms.
LaTeX users can be achieved this by use of the <i>fontenc</i>
package (part of the LaTeX distribution).  If you select an 8-bit
font with the package, as in <code>\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}</code>,
accented-letter commands such as the <code>\'</code><code>e</code> in
<code>\hyphenation{Ji-m\'</code><code>e-nez}</code> automatically become the single accented
character by the time the hyphenation gets a to look at it.
