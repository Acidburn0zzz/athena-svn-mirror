<h3>Typesetting music in TeX</h3>
<p>In the early days, a simple music package called <i>mutex</i> was
written by Angelika Schofer and Andrea Steinbach, which demonstrated
that music typesetting was possible; the package was very limited, and
is no longer available.  Daniel Taupin took up the baton, and
developed MusicTeX, which allows the typesetting of
polyphonic and other multiple-stave music; MusicTeX remains
available, but is most definitely no longer recommended.
<p>MusicTeX has 
been superseded by its successor MusiXTeX, which is a three-pass
system (with a processor program that computes values for the element
spacing in the music), and achieves finer control than is possible in
the unmodified TeX-based mechanism that MusicTeX uses.  Daniel
Taupin's is the only version of MusiXTeX currently being developed
(the original author, Andreas Egler, had an alternative version, but he
is now working on a different package altogether).
<p>Input to MusixTeX is extremely tricky stuff, and Don Simons'
preprocessor <i>pmx</i> is the preferred method of creating input
for Taupin's version.  <i>Pmx</i> greatly eases use of
MusixTeX, but it doesn't support the full range of MusixTeX's
facilities directly; however, it does allow in-line MusixTeX code
in <i>pmx</i> sources.
<p>Dirk Laurie's <i>M-Tx</i> allows preparation of music with lyrics;
it operates "on top of" <i>pmx</i>
<p>Another simple notation is supported by <i>abc2mtex</i>;
this is a package designed to notate tunes stored in an ASCII format
(<code>abc</code> notation). It was designed primarily for folk and traditional
tunes of Western European origin (such as Irish, English and Scottish)
which can be written on one stave in standard classical notation, and
creates input intended for MusicTeX.
However, it should be extendable to many other types of music.
<p>Digital music fans can typeset notation for their efforts by using
<i>midi2tex</i>, which translates MIDI data files into MusicTeX
source code.
<p>There is a mailing list (<i>TeX-music@sunsite.dk</i>) for discussion
of typesetting music in TeX.
