<h3>Future WEB technologies and (La)TeX</h3>
<p>An earlier question

(<a href="FAQ70.html">"converting to HTML"</a>) 


addresses the issue of converting existing (La)TeX documents for
viewing on the Web as HTML.  All the present techniques are
somewhat flawed: the answer explains why.
<p>However, things are changing, with
better font availability, cunning HTML programming and the
support for new Web standards.
<dl>
<dt>Font technologies<dd> Direct representation of mathematics in
  browsers has been hampered up to now by the limited range of symbols
  in the fonts one can rely on being available.  In the near future,
  we can expect rather wide availability of Unicode fonts with better
  coverage of symbols.
<dt>XML<dd> The core of the range of new standards is
  XML, which provides a framework for better structured markup;
  limited support for for it has already appeared in some browswers.
<p>  Conversion of (La)TeX source to XML is already available
  (through TeX4ht at least), and work continues in that arena.  The
  alternative, authoring in XML (thus producing documents that
  are immediately Web-friendly, if not ready) and using (La)TeX to
  typeset is also well advanced.  One useful technique is
  <em>transforming</em> the XML to LaTeX, using XSLT,
  and then simply using LaTeX; alternatively, one may
  
  
  <a href="FAQ71.html">typeset direct from the XML source</a>.
<p><dt>Direct represention of mathematics<dd> 
  MathML is a standard for representing maths on the Web; its
  original version is distinctly limited, but efforts to give it
  greater richness (approaching that of TeX) are under way.
  Browser support for MathML (e.g., in <i>amaya</i>, a
  version of the Netscape 'Open Source' browser <i>mozilla</i> and
  in specially extended versions of <i>Internet</i>
  <i>Explorer</i>) is becoming available.  There's evidence that
  (La)TeX users are starting to use such browsers.
<p>  Work in both the TeX4ht and <i>TtH</i> projects, to produce
  MathML is well advanced.
<p><dt>Graphics<dd> 
  SVG is a standard for graphics representation on the web.
  While the natural use is for converting existing figures,
  representations of formulas are also possible, in place of the separate
  bitmaps that have been used in the past (and while we wait for the
  wide deployment of MathML).
<p>  Browser plug-ins, that deal with SVG are already available
  (Adobe offer one, for example).
