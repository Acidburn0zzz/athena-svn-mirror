<h3>Acquiring bitmap fonts</h3>
<p>When CTAN was established, most people would start using TeX
with a 300 dots-per-inch (dpi) laser printer, and sets of Computer
Modern bitmap fonts for this resolution are available on CTAN
(there are separate sets for write-black and write-white printers.
<p>At that time, there were regular requests that CTAN should hold
a wider range of resolutions, but they were resisted for two reasons:
<ol>
<li> When a bitmap font is created with Metafont, it needs to know the
  characteristics of the device; who knows what 600 or 1270 dpi device
  you have?  (Of course, this objection applies equally well to
  300 dpi printers.)
<li> Bitmap fonts get <em>big</em> at high resolutions. Who knows what
  fonts at what sizes people are going to need?
</ol>
Fortunately, (La)TeX distribution technology has put a stop to these
arguments: most (if not all) current distributions generate bitmap
fonts as needed, and cache them for later re-use.  The impatient
user, who is determined that all bitmap fonts should be created once
and for all, may be supported by scripts such as <i>allcm</i>
(distributed with teTeX, at least; otherwise such a person should
consult <a href="FAQ79.html">"the use of Metafont"</a>).
<p>If your output is to a PostScript-capable device, it may be worth
switching to Type 1 versions of the CM fonts.  Two free
versions are currently available; the older (<i>bakoma</i>) is
somewhat less well produced than the <i>bluesky</i> fonts, which were
originally professionally produced and sold, but were then donated to
the public domain by their originators Y&amp;Y and Bluesky Research,
in association with the AMS).  Unfortunately, the coverage of
the sets is slightly different, but the present author hasn't found
the need to use <i>bakoma</i> since <i>bluesky</i> became
available.  In recent years, several other 'Metafont' fonts have become
available in Type 1 format; it's common never to find the need of
generating bitmap fonts for any purpose other than previewing (see

<a href="FAQ83.html">"previewing documents with Type 1 fonts"</a>).
<p>The commercial font suppliers continue just to keep ahead of the free
software movement, and provide Type 1 versions of the EC fonts,
CM-style Cyrillic fonts, as well as a range of mathematical
fonts to replace those in the CM family (see
<a href="FAQ86.html">"choice of scalable fonts"</a>).
