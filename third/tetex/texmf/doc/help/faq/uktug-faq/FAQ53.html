<h3>TeX CDROMs</h3>
<p>If you don't have access to the Internet, there are obvious
attractions to TeX collections on a CDROM.  Even those with net
access will find large quantities of TeX-related files to hand a
great convenience.
<p>Ready-to-run TeX systems on CDROM are available:
<ul>
<li> A consortium of User Groups (notably TUG,
  UK TUG and GUTenberg) distributes the
  TeX Live CDROM, now in its sixth edition.  All members of
  several User Groups receive copies free of charge.  Some user groups
  will also sell additional copies: contact your local user group or
  <a href="FAQ21.html">TUG</a>.
<p>
  Details of TeX Live are available from its own
  <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive.html">web page</a>
  on the TUG site.
<li> The Dutch TeX Users Group (NTG) publish the whole
  4AllTeX workbench on a 2-CDROM set packed with all the
  Windows TeX software, macros and fonts you can want. It is
  available from 

  <a href="http://www.ntg.nl/">NTG</a>
  direct, from TUG for
  $40 and from UK TUG for &pound;30 (a manual is
  included). It is a useful resource for anyone to browse, not just
  for Windows users.
</ul>
<p>An alternative to the ready-to-run system is the CTAN archive
snapshot; in general one would expect that such systems would be
harder to use, but that the volume of resources offered would balance
this extra inconvenience.  There were once commercial offerings in
this field, but nowadays the snapshot supplied to user group members
annually is about the only source of such things.
