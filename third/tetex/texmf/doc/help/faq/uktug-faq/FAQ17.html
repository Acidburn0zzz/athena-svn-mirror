<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 17</title>
</head><body>
<h3>If TeX is so good, how come it's free?</h3>
<p>It's free because Knuth chose to make it so.  He is nevertheless
apparently happy
that others should earn money by selling TeX-based services and
products. While several valuable TeX-related tools and packages are
offered subject to restrictions imposed by the GNU General Public
Licence ('Copyleft'), TeX itself is not subject to Copyleft.
<p>There are commercial versions of TeX available; for some users,
it's reassuring to have paid support.  What is more, some of the
commercial implementations
have features that are not available in free versions.  (The
reverse is also true: some free implementations have features
not available commercially.)
<p>This FAQ concentrates on 'free' distributions of TeX, but we
do at least list the

  <a href="FAQ56.html">major vendors</a>.
