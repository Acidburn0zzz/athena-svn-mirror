<h3>My section title is too wide for the page header</h3>
<p>By default, LaTeX sectioning commands make the chapter or section
title available for use by page headers and the like.  Page headers
operate in a rather constrained area, and it's common for titles too
be too big to fit: the LaTeX sectioning commands therefore take an
optional argument:
<pre>
\section[short title]{full title}
</pre>
If the &lt;<em>short title</em>&gt; is present, it is used both for the table of
contents and for the page heading: the usual answer to people who
complain about the size of the title that's gone in to the running
head, is to suggest that they the optional argument.
<p>However, using the same text for the table of contents as for the
running head may also be unsatisfactory: if your chapter titles are
seriously long (like those of a Victorian novel), a valid and rational
scheme is to have a shortened table of contents entry, and a really
terse entry in the running head.
<p>In fact, the sectioning commands use 'mark' commands to pass
information to the page headers.  For example, <code>\chapter</code> uses
<code>\chaptermark</code>, <code>\section</code> uses <code>\sectionmark</code>, and so on.  With
this knowledge, one can achieve a three-layer structure for chapters:
<pre>
\chapter[middling version]{verbose version}
\chaptermark{terse version}
</pre>
which should supply the needs of every taste.
<p>Chapters, however, have it easy: hardly any book design puts a page
header on a chapter start page.  In the case of sections, one has
typically to take account of the nature of the <code>\*mark</code> commands:
the thing that goes in the heading is the first mark on the page (or,
failing any mark, the last mark on any previous page).  As a result
the recipe for sections is more tiresome:
<pre>
\section[middling version]{verbose version%
                \sectionmark{terse version}}
\sectionmark{terse version}
</pre>
(the first <code>\sectionmark</code> deals with the header of the page the
<code>\section</code> command falls on, and the second deal with subsequent
pages; note that here, you need the optional argument to <code>\section</code>,
even if "<em>middling version</em>" is in fact the same text as
"<em>long version"</em>.)
<p>A similar arrangement is necessary even for chapters if the class
you're using is odd enough that it puts a page header on a chapter's
opening page.
<p>Note that the <i>titlesec</i> package manages the running heads in
a completely different fashion; users of that package should refer to
the documentation.
