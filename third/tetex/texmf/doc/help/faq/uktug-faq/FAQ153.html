<h3>Typesetting URLs</h3>
<p>URLs tend to be very long, and contain characters that would
naturally prevent them being hyphenated even if they weren't typically
set in <code>\ttfamily</code>, verbatim.  Therefore, without special treatment,
they often produce wildly overfull <code>\hbox</code>es, and their typeset
representation is awful.
<p>There are three packages that help solve this problem:
<ul>
<li> The <i>path</i> package, which defines a <code>\path</code> command.
  The command defines each potential break character as a
  <code>\discretionary</code>, and offers the user the opportunity of
  specifying a personal list of potential break characters.  Its chief
  disadvantage is fragility in LaTeX moving arguments.  (The

  <a href="FAQ14.html">Eplain macros</a>
  define a similar <code>\path</code> command.)
<li> The <i>url</i> package, which defines an <code>\url</code> command
  (among others, including its own <code>\path</code> command).  The command
  gives each potential break character a maths-mode 'personality', and
  then sets the URL itself (in the user's choice of font) in
  maths mode.  It can produce (LaTeX-style) 'robust' commands
  
  (see <a href="FAQ230.html">use of <code>\protect</code></a>) for use
  within moving arguments.  Note that, because the operation is
  conducted in maths mode, spaces within the URL argument are
  ignored unless special steps are taken.
<p>  It is possible to use the <i>url</i> package in Plain TeX,
  with the assistance of the <i>miniltx</i> package (which was
  originally developed for using the LaTeX graphics package in
  Plain TeX).  A small patch is also necessary: the required
  sequence is therefore:

<pre>
\input miniltx
\expandafter\def\expandafter\+\expandafter{\+}
\input url.sty
</pre>
<li> The <i>hyperref</i> package, which uses the typesetting code
  of <i>url</i>, in a context where the typeset text forms the
  anchor of a link.
</ul>
<p>The author of this answer prefers the (rather newer) <i>url</i>
package (directly or indirectly);
both <i>path</i> and <i>url</i> work well with Plain TeX
(though of course, the fancy LaTeX facilities of <i>url</i>
don't have much place there).  (<i>hyperref</i> isn't available in
a version for use with Plain TeX.)
<p>Documentation of both <i>path</i> and <i>url</i> is in the
package files.
