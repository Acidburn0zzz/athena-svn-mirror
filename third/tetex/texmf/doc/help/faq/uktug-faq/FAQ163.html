<h3>Multiple indexes</h3>
<p>LaTeX's standard indexing capabilities (those provided by the
<i>makeidx</i> package) only provide for one index in your
document; even quite modest documents can be improved by indexes for
separate topics.
<p>The <i>multind</i> package provides simple and straightforward
multiple indexing.  You tag each <code>\makeindex</code>, <code>\index</code> and
<code>\printindex</code> command with a file name, and indexing commands are
written to (or read from) the name with the appropriate (<code>.idx</code> or
<code>.ind</code>) extension appended.  The <code>\printindex</code> command is modified
from the LaTeX standard so that it doesn't create its own chapter
or section heading; you therefore decide what names (or sectioning
level, even) to use for the indexes, and 
<a href="FAQ226.html"><code>\indexname</code></a> is completely ignored.
<p>The <i>index</i> package provides a comprehensive set of indexing
facilities, including a <code>\newindex</code> command that allows the
definition of new styles of index.  <code>\newindex</code> takes a 'tag' (for
use in indexing commands), replacements for the <code>.idx</code> and <code>.ind</code> file
extensions, and a title for the index when it's finally printed; it
can also change the item that's being indexed against (for example,
one might have an index of artists referenced by the figure number
where their work is shown).
<p>The <i>splitidx</i> package (which comes with a small executable
<i>splitindex</i> available for a variety of platforms) is another
alternative.  It supports the sorts of things that the <i>index</i>
package does, but is not limited by the number of output streams
(La)TeX can have open at any one time.
