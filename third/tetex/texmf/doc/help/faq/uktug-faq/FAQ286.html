<h3>What to do if you find a bug</h3>




<p>For a start, make entirely sure you <em>have</em> found a bug.
Double-check with books about TeX, LaTeX, or whatever you're using;
compare what you're seeing against the other answers above; ask every
possible person you know who has any TeX-related expertise.
The reasons for all this caution are various.
<p>If you've found a bug in TeX itself, you're a rare animal indeed.
Don Knuth is so sure of the quality of his code that he offers real
money prizes to finders of bugs; the cheques he writes are
such rare items that they are seldom cashed. If <em>you</em>
think you have found a genuine fault in TeX itself (or Metafont, or the
CM fonts, or the TeXbook), don't immediately write to Knuth,
however. He only looks at bugs once or twice a year, and even then
only after they are agreed as bugs by a small vetting team. In the
first instance, contact Barbara Beeton at the AMS
(<i>bnb@math.ams.org</i>), or contact
<a href="FAQ21.html">TUG</a>.
<p>If you've found a bug in LaTeX2e, you may 
<a href="FAQ285.html">report it</a> using mechanisms supplied in
the LaTeX distribution.
<p>If you've found a bug in LaTeX 2.09, or some other such unsupported
software, there's not a lot you can do about it.  You may find help or
<em>de facto</em> support on a newsgroup such as
<i>comp.tex.tex</i> or on a mailing list such as
<a href="mailto:texhax@tex.ac.uk"><i>texhax@tex.ac.uk</i></a>, but posting non-bugs to any of these forums
can lay you open to ridicule!  Otherwise you need to go out and find
yourself a willing TeX-consultant - TUG maintains a
register of TeX consultants (see
<a href="http://www.tug.org/consultants.html">http://www.tug.org/consultants.html</a>).
