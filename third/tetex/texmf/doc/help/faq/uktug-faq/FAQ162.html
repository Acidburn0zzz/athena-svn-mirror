<h3>Bibliography, index, etc., in TOC</h3>
<p>The standard LaTeX classes (and many others) use <code>\section*</code> or
<code>\chapter*</code> for auto-generated parts of the document (the tables of
contents, figures and tables, the bibliography and the index).  As a
result, these items aren't numbered (which most people don't mind),
and (more importantly) they don't appear in the table of contents.
<p>The correct solution (as always) is to have a class of your own that
formats your document according to your requirements.  The macro to do
the job (<code>\addcontentsline</code>) is fairly simple, but there is always
an issue of ensuring that the contents entry quotes the correct page:
<pre>
  \bibliography{frooble}
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
</pre>
will produce the <em>wrong</em> answer if the bibliography is more than
one page long.  Instead, one should say:
<pre>
  \cleardoublepage
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Bibliography}
  \bibliography{frooble}
</pre>
(Note that <code>\cleardoublepage</code> does the right thing, even if your
document is single-sided - in that case, it's a synonym for
<code>\clearpage</code>).  Ensuring that the entry refers to the right place is
trickier still in a <code>\section</code>-based class.
<p>The common solution, therefore, is to use the <i>tocbibind</i>
package, which provides many facilities to control the way these
entries appear in the table of contents.
<p>Of course, the <em>KOMA-Script</em> bundle of classes (<i>scrbook</i>
instead of <i>book</i>, <i>scrreprt</i> instead of <i>report</i>,
etc.) provide this functionality as a set of class options.
