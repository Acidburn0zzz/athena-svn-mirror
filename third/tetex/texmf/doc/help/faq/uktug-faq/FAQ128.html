<h3>Alternative head- and footlines in LaTeX</h3>
<p>The standard LaTeX document classes define a small set of 'page
styles' which (in effect) specify head- and footlines for your
document.  The set defined is very restricted, but LaTeX is capable
of much more; people occasionally set about employing LaTeX
facilities to do the job, but that's quite unnecessary - Piet van
Oostrum has already done the work.
<p>The package <i>fancyhdr</i> provides
simple mechanisms for defining pretty much every head- or footline
variation you could want; the directory also contains some (rather
good) documentation and one or two smaller packages.  <i>Fancyhdr</i>
also deals with the tedious behaviour of the standard styles with

  <a href="FAQ138.html">initial pages</a>,
by enabling you to define
different page styles for initial and for body pages.
