<h3>The PDFTeX project</h3>
<p>PDFTeX (formerly known as TeX2PDF) arose from

  Han The Thanh's
post-graduate research at Masaryk University, Brno, Czech
Republic.  The basic idea is very simple: to provide a version of
TeX that can output PDF as an alternative format to
DVI.  PDFTeX implements a small number of new
primitives, to switch to PDF output, and to control various
PDF features.

  Han The Thanh
has worked on PDFTeX throughout his Ph.D. research into
typesetting, and the latest release includes facilities written to
support novel typesetting techniques.
<p>The latest version of PDFTeX is available on CTAN,
and implementations are available as part the teTeX, mikTeX,
fpTeX, and CMacTeX distributions (see
<a href="FAQ54.html">TeX systems</a>); it is also distributed
on the TeX Live CDROM
(see <a href="FAQ53.html">TeX CDROMs</a>).
A version (by the author of CMacTeX) for use with OzTeX is also
available on CTAN.
<p>A mailing list discussing PDFTeX is available; send a message
containing (just) <code>subscribe pdftex</code> to <i>majordomo@tug.org</i> (you
will be required to confirm your subscription).
