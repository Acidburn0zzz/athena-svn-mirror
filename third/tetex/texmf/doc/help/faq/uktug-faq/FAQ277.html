<h3>The Omega project</h3>
<p>Omega

is a program built by extension of the TeX sources which works
internally with 'wide' characters (it is capable of dealing with all
of Unicode version 3); this allows it to work with most scripts in the
world with few difficulties from coding schemes.
Omega also has a
powerful concept of input and output filters to allow the user to work
with existing transliteration schemes, <em>etc</em>.

<p>Omega was first released in November 1996
by the project originators, John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous; a
recent version is maintained on
CTAN.  However, Omega is now
an open source project, and details of a <i>cvs</i> repository, as
well as papers and other information, are available via the

  <a href="http://omega.cse.unsw.edu.au">project's web site</a>.
<p>Implementations of Omega
are available as part of the teTeX,
mikTeX, fpTeX and CMacTeX distributions
(see <a href="FAQ54.html">TeX systems</a>);
Omega is also
distributed on the TeX Live CDROM
(see <a href="FAQ53.html">TeX CDROMs</a>).
