<h3>Contributing a file to the archives</h3>
<p>If you are able to use anonymous <code>ftp</code>, get yourself a copy of
the file <i>README.uploads</i> from any

<a href="FAQ46.html">CTAN archive</a>.  The file tells you
where to upload, what to upload, and how to notify the CTAN
management about what you want doing with your upload.
<p>You may also upload via the Web: each of the principle CTAN
sites offers an upload page - choose from
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/upload.html">http://www.ctan.org/upload.html</a>,
<a href="http://www.dante.de/CTAN/upload.html">http://www.dante.de/CTAN/upload.html</a> or
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/upload.html">http://www.tex.ac.uk/upload.html</a>; the pages lead you through the
process, showing you the information you need to supply.
<p>If you can use neither of these methods, ask advice of the

  <a href="mailto:ctan@dante.de">CTAN management</a>:
if the worst comes to the worst, it may be possible to mail a contribution.
<p>You will make
everyone's life easier if you choose a descriptive and unique name for
your submission.  Descriptiveness is in the eye of the beholder, but
do try and be reasonable; and it's probably a good idea to check that
your chosen name is not already in use by browsing the archive 

(see <a href="FAQ50.html">finding files via ftp</a>), or the Catalogue
(see <a href="FAQ51.html">finding files via the web</a>).
<p>If it's appropriate (if your package is large, or regularly updated),
the CTAN management can arrange to <i>mirror</i> your
contribution direct into the archive.  At present this may only be
done if your contribution is available via <code>ftp</code>, and of course the
directory structure on your archive must 'fit'.
