<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 253</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Why does it ignore paragraph parameters?</h3>
<p>When TeX is laying out text, it doesn't work from word to word, or
from line to line; the smallest complete unit it formats is the
paragraph.  The paragraph is laid down in a buffer, as it appears, and
isn't touched further until the end-paragraph marker is processed.
It's at this point that the paragraph parameters have effect; and it's
because of this sequence that one often makes mistakes that lead to
the paragraph parameters not doing what one would have hoped (or
expected).
<p>Consider the following sequence of LaTeX:
<pre>
  {\raggedright % declaration for ragged text
  Here's text to be ranged left in our output,
  but it's the only such paragraph, so we now
  end the group.}

  Here's more that needn't be ragged...
</pre>
TeX will open a group, and set the ragged-setting parameters within
that group; it will then save a couple of sentences of text and
close the group (thus restoring the previous value of the
ragged-setting parameters).  Then it encounters a blank line, which it
knows to treat as a <code>\par</code> token, so it typesets the two sentences;
but because the enclosing group has now been closed, the parameter
settings have been lost, and the paragraph will be typeset normally.
<p>The solution is simple: close the paragraph inside the group, so that
the setting parameters remain in place.  An appropriate way of doing
that is to replace the last three lines above with:
<pre>
  end the group.\par}
  Here's more that needn't be ragged...
</pre>
In this way, the paragraph is completed while the setting parameters
are still in force within the enclosing group.
<p>Another alternative is to define an environment that does the
appropriate job for you.  For the above example, LaTeX already
defines an appropriate one:
<pre>
\begin{flushleft}
  Here's text to be ranged left...
\end{flushleft}
</pre>
