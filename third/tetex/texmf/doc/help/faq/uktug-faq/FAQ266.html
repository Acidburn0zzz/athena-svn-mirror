<h3><code>epsf</code> gives up after a bit</h3>
<p>Some copies of the documentation of <i>epsf.tex</i> seem to suggest
that the command
<pre>
  \input epsf
</pre>
is needed for every figure included.  If you follow this suggestion
too literally, you get an error
<pre>
  ! No room for a new \read .
</pre>
after a while; this is because each time <i>epsf.tex</i> is loaded, it
allocates itself a <em>new</em> file-reading handle to check the figure
for its bounding box, and there just aren't enough of these things
(see <a href="FAQ265.html">no room for a new thing</a>).
<p>The solution is simple - this is in fact an example of misuse of
macros; one only need read <i>epsf.tex</i> once, so change
<pre>
  ...
  \input epsf
  \epsffile{...}
  ...
  \input epsf
  \epsffile{...}
</pre>
(and so on) with a single
<pre>
  \input epsf
</pre>
somewhere near the start of your document, and then decorate your
<code>\epsffile</code> statements with no more than adjustments of
<code>\epsfxsize</code> and so on.
