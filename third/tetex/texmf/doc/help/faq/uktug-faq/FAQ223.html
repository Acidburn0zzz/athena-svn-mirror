<h3>Active characters in command arguments</h3>
<p>Occasionally, it's nice to make one or two characters active in the
argument of a command, to make it easier for authors to code the
arguments.
<p>Active characters <em>can</em> be used safely in such situations; but
care is needed.
<p>An example arose while this answer was being considered: an aspirant
macro writer posted to <i>comp.text.tex</i> asking for help to
make <code>#</code> and <code>b</code> produce musical sharp and flat signs, respectively,
in a macro for specifying chords.
<p>The first problem is that both <code>#</code> and <code>b</code> have rather important uses
elsewhere in TeX (to say the least!), so that the characters can
only be made active while the command is executing.
<p>Using the techniques discussed in 
"<a href="FAQ222.html">characters as commands</a>",
we can define:
<pre>
\begingroup
  \catcode`\#=\active
  \gdef#{$\sharp$}
\endgroup
</pre>
and:
<pre>
\begingroup
  \lccode`\~=`\b
  \lowercase{\endgroup
    \def~{$\flat$}%
  }
</pre>
<p>The second problem is one of timing: the command has to make each
character active <em>before</em> its arguments are read: this means that
the command can't actually "have" arguments itself, but must be
split in two.  So we write:
<pre>
\def\chord{%
  \begingroup
    \catcode`\#=\active
    \catcode`\b=\active
    \Xchord
}
\def\Xchord#1{%
    \chordfont#1%
  \endgroup
}
</pre>
and we can use the command as <code>\chord{F#}</code> or
<code>\chord{Bb minor}</code>.
<p>Two features of the coding are important:
<ul>
<li> <code>\begingroup</code> in <code>\chord</code> opens a group that is closed by
  <code>\endgroup</code> in <code>\Xchord</code>; this group limits the change of
  category codes, which is the <em>raison d'\^etre</em> of the whole
  exercise.
<li> Although <code>#</code> is active while <code>\Xchord</code> is executed, it's
  <em>not</em> active when it's being defined, so that the use of <code>#1</code>
  doesn't require any special attention.
</ul>
<p>Note that the technique used in such macros as <code>\chord</code>, here, is
analagous to that used in such commands as <code>\verb</code>; and, in just the
same way as <code>\verb</code> (see

"<a href="FAQ250.html"><code>\verb</code> doesn't work in arguments</a>"),
<code>\chord</code> won't work inside the argument of another command (the
error messages, if they appear at all, will probably be rather odd).
