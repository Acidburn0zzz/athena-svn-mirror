<h3>Capitalisation in BibTeX</h3>
<p>The standard BibTeX bibliography styles impose fixed ideas about
the capitalisation of titles of things in the bibliography.  While
this is not unreasonable by BibTeX's lights (the rules come from
the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>) it can be troublesome, since
BibTeX fails to recognise special uses (such as acronyms).
<p>The solution is to enclose the letter or letters, whose capitalisation
BibTeX should not touch, in braces, as:
<pre>
  title = {The {THE} operating system},
</pre>
Sometimes you find BibTeX changing the case of a single letter
inappropriately.  No matter: the technique can be applied to single
letters, as in:
<pre>
  title = {Te{X}niques and tips},
</pre>
<p>If your document design specification requires a different style of
capitalisation, you should acquire a bibliography style that doesn't
enforce BibTeX's default rules.  It is definitely <em>not</em> a good
idea to enclose an entire title in braces, as in
<pre>
  title = {{TeXniques and tips}},
</pre>
though that does ensure that the capitalisation is not changed.  Your
BibTeX database should be a general-purpose thing, not something
tuned to the requirements of a particular document, or to the way you
are thinking today.
