<h3>'Watermarks' on every page</h3>
<p>It's often useful to place some text (such as 'DRAFT') in the
background of every page of a document.  For LaTeX users, this can
be achieved with the <i>draftcopy</i> package.  This can deal with
many types of DVI processors (in the same way that the graphics
package does) and knows translations for the word 'DRAFT' into a wide
range of languages (though you can choose your own word, too).
<p>More elaborate watermarks may be achieved using the <i>eso-pic</i>
package, which in turn uses the package <i>everyshi</i>, part of
Martin Schr&ouml;der's <i>ms</i> bundle.  <i>Eso-pic</i> attaches a
<code>picture</code> environment to every page as it is shipped out;
you can put things into that environment.  The package provides
commands for placing things at certain useful points (like "text
upper left" or "text centre") in the picture, but you're at liberty
to do what you like.
