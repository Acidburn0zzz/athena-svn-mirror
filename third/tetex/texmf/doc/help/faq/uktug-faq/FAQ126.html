<h3>How to create a <code>\subsubsubsection</code></h3>
<p>LaTeX's set of "sections" stops at the level of
<code>\subsubsection</code>.  This reflects a design decision by Lamport -
for, after all, who can reasonably want a section with such huge
strings of numbers in front of it?
<p>In fact, LaTeX standard classes <em>do</em> define "sectioning"
levels lower than <code>\subsubsection</code>, but they don't format them like
sections (they're not numbered, and the text is run-in after the
heading).  These deeply inferior section commands are <code>\paragraph</code>
and <code>\subparagraph</code>; you can (if you <em>must</em>) arrange that these
two commands produce numbered headings, so that you can use them as
<code>\subsubsubsection</code>s and lower.
<p>The <i>titlesec</i> allows you to adjust the definitions of the
sectioning macros, and it may be used to
transform a <code>\paragraph</code>'s typesetting so that it looks like that
of a <code>\section</code>.
<p>If you want to program the change yourself, you'll find that the
commands (<code>\section</code> all the way down to <code>\subparagraph</code>) are
defined in terms of the internal <code>\@startsection</code> command, which
takes 6 arguments.  Before attempting this sort of work, you are well
advised to read the LaTeX sources (<i>ltsect.dtx</i> in the
LaTeX distribution) and the source of the standard packages
(<i>classes.dtx</i>).

The 
<a href="FAQ22.html">LaTeX companion</a> discusses use of
<code>\@startsection</code> for this sort of thing.
