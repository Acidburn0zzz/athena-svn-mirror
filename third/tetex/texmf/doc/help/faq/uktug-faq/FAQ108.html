<h3>Multiple citations</h3>
<p>A convention sometimes used in physics journals is to "collapse" a group of
related citations into a single entry in the bibliography.  BibTeX,
by default, can't cope with this arrangement, but the <i>mcite</i>
package deals with the problem.
<p>The package overloads the <code>\cite</code> command, so that citations of the
form <code>\cite{paper1,paper2}</code> appear in the document as a
single citation, and appear arranged appropriately in the bibliography
itself.  You need to alter the bibliography style (<code>.bst</code>) file you
use; the pakage documentation tells you how to do that.
