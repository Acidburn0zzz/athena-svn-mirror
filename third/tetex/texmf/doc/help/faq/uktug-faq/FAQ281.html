<h3>The TeXtrace project</h3>
<p>TeXtrace is a bundle of Unix scripts that use a freeware boundary
tracing package to generate Type 1 outline fonts from Metafont bitmap
font outputs.  The result is unlikely ever to be of the quality of
the commercially-produced Type 1 font, but there remain fonts which
many people find useful and which fail to attract the paid experts.
<p>The project was started by P&eacute;ter Szab&oacute;, and its current state is
available via the

<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/textrace/">project's entry on Sourceforge</a>
and there are already a few sets of fonts on CTAN generated
using TeXtrace: P&eacute;ter Szab&oacute;'s own EC/TC font set,
Vladimir Volovich's CM-Super set, which covers the EC,
TC, and the Cyrillic LH font sets, and Takanori
Uchiyama's set of the MusixTeX fonts.
<p>A package that says it's "inspired" by TeXtrace is
<i>pktrace</i>: this is a small <i>Python</i> program that
does the same job~- see <a href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~hanwen/pktrace/">http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~hanwen/pktrace/</a>;
it has not yet been used to generate fonts that have been installed on
CTAN.
