<h3>What's going on in my <code>\include</code> commands?</h3>
<p>The original LaTeX provided the <code>\include</code> command to address the
problem of long documents: with the relatively slow computers of the
time, the companion <code>\includeonly</code> facility was a boon.  With the
vast increase in computer speed, <code>\includeonly</code> is less valuable
(though it still has its place in some very large projects).
Nevertheless, the facility is retained in current LaTeX, and causes
some confusion to those who misunderstand it.
<p>In order for <code>\includeonly</code> to work, <code>\include</code> makes a separate
<code>.aux</code> file for each included file, and makes a 'checkpoint' of
important parameters (such as page, figure, table and footnote
numbers); as a direct result, it <em>must</em> clear the current page
both before and after the <code>\include</code> command.  What's more, this
mechanism doesn't work if a <code>\include</code> command appears in a file
that was <code>\include</code>d itself: LaTeX diagnoses this as an error.
<p>So, we can now answer the two commonest questions about <code>\include</code>:
<ul>
<li> Why does LaTeX throw a page before and after <code>\include</code>
  commands?
<p>  Answer: because it has to.  If you don't like it, replace the
  <code>\include</code> command with <code>\input</code> - you won't be able to use
  <code>\includeonly</code> any more, but you probably don't need it anyway, so
  don't worry.
<p><li> Why can't I nest <code>\include</code>d files? - I always used to be
  able to under LaTeX 2.09.
<p>  Answer: in fact, you couldn't, even under LaTeX 2.09, but the failure
  wasn't diagnosed.  However, since you were happy with the behaviour
  under LaTeX 2.09, replace the <code>\include</code> commands with <code>\input</code>
  commands (with <code>\clearpage</code> as appropriate).
</ul>
