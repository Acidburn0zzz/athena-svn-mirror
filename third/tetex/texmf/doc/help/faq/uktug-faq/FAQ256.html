<h3>Getting <code>\marginpar</code> on the right side</h3>
<p>In <code>twoside</code> documents, LaTeX makes sterling attempts to put
<code>\marginpar</code>s in the correct margin (the outer or the gutter margin,
according to the user's command).  However, a booby-trap arises
because TeX runs its page maker asynchronously.  If a
<code>\marginpar</code> is processed while page <i>n</i> is being being built, but
doesn't get used until page <i>n</i>+1, then the <code>\marginpar</code> will turn
up on the wrong side of the page.  This is an instance of a general
problem: see

"<a href="FAQ234.html">finding if you're on an odd or an even page</a>".
<p>The solution to the problem is for LaTeX to 'remember' which side
of the page each <code>\marginpar</code> <em>should</em> be on.  The
<i>mparhack</i> package does this, using marks stored in the <code>.aux</code>
file.
