<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 25</title>
</head><body>
<h3>Where to get help</h3>
<p>First ... read any FAQ you can find.  (Which is what you're
doing now, isn't it?)
<p>An ambitious FAQ-like project to collect all TeX-related
information into one place is under way at
<a href="http://www.ctv.es/USERS/irmina/TeEncontreX.html">http://www.ctv.es/USERS/irmina/TeEncontreX.html</a>; as with any
FAQ, this project needs the support and help of all users -
as yet, it carries an incomplete set of answers to potential
questions.  The sources of the package (including a complete set of
<code>html</code> files) are available on CTAN
<p>The tutorials and other on-line documentation (see
<a href="FAQ27.html">(La)TeX Tutorials</a>) can get you started but
for more in-depth understanding you should get and read at least one of the
many good books on the subject
(see <a href="FAQ22.html">TeX-related books</a>). The definitive source for
(La)TeX is the source code itself, but that is not something to be 
approached lightly (if at all).
<p>    If you are seeking a particular package or program, look on your own
system first: you might already have it - the better TeX
distributions contain a wide range of supporting material.
<p>    If you have access to the internet, and in particular newsgroups,
then (La)TeX discussions, including Metafont and MetaPost, are on
<i>comp.text.tex</i>.
It is best to
spend a little time familiarising yourself with the current threads before
asking a question. The group is normally very responsive but asking a question
that has just been answered is likely to dampen people's enthusiasm to help
you. 
<p><a href="http://groups.google.com/">http://groups.google.com/</a> archives Usenet news discussions, and
<i>comp.text.tex</i> may be found there.  Google's archive now
goes impressively far back in time (before <i>comp.text.tex</i>
even existed), and it is a powerful resource for tracking down that
recommendation that no-one can now remember.  Google also now allows
you to post your own questions or followups.
<p>The few people who can't use the World Wide Web, can't access Usenet
news, but can use electronic mail can seek help through mailing lists.
<p>The TeXhax digest is nowadays operated as a moderated
"<i>MailMan</i>" mailing list: its members now have the option
of receiving messages in 'real time', and answers are more quickly
forthcoming than ever they were in the past.  Subscribe via
<a href="http://lists.nottingham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/texhax">http://lists.nottingham.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/texhax</a>; past
digests are available on CTAN.
<p>Many mailing lists exist that cover some small part of the TeX
arena.  A good source of pointers is <a href="http://www.tug.org/">http://www.tug.org/</a>
<p>Announcements of TeX-related installations on the CTAN
archives are sent to the mailing list <code>ctan-ann</code>.  Subscribe
to the list by sending a message

'<code>subscribe ctan-ann &lt;your email address&gt;</code>' to
<a href="mailto:majordomo@dante.de"><i>majordomo@dante.de</i></a>
<p>Issues related to Metafont (and, increasingly, MetaPost) are discussed on
the <code>metafont</code> mailing list; subscribe by sending a message
'<code>subscribe metafont &lt;<em>your name</em>&gt;</code>' to <a href="mailto:listserv@ens.fr"><i>listserv@ens.fr</i></a>
<p>A few other TeX-related lists may be accessed via

the line '<code>help</code>' to this address, or browse
