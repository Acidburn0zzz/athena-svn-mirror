<h3>Where to put new files</h3>
<p>Where precisely you put files that you have downloaded does
depend on what TeX distribution you have. However,
assuming that you have one of the modern TDS-compliant
distributions (such as teTeX, fpTeX or mikTeX) there are
some general rules that you can follow:
<p>



(1) Always install new files in a local <i>texmf</i>
tree. The root directory will be named something like:
<pre>
 teTeX:          /usr/share/texmf-local/ or
                 /usr/local/share/texmf/
 fpTeX:          c:\fptex\texmf.local\
 mikTeX:         c:\localtexmf\
</pre>
(In fact, a teTeX system can be asked to tell you what its local
root is; on a Unix system, the command to use is:
<pre>
  kpsewhich -expand-var \$TEXMFLOCAL
</pre>
the output being the actual path.)
<p>Let's write <code>$TEXMF</code> for this root, whatever it is for your system.
<p>
(2) In your local texmf tree, imitate the directory structure in your
main tree. Here's some examples of where files of given extensions should
go:
<pre>
.sty, .cls or .fd: $TEXMF/tex/latex/&lt;package&gt;/
.dvi, .ps or .pdf: $TEXMF/doc/latex/&lt;package&gt;/
.mf:   $TEXMF/fonts/source/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.tfm:  $TEXMF/fonts/tfm/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.vf:   $TEXMF/fonts/vf/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.afm:  $TEXMF/fonts/afm/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.pfb:  $TEXMF/fonts/type1/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
.ttf:  $TEXMF/fonts/truetype/&lt;supplier&gt;/&lt;font&gt;/
</pre>
Where of course &lt;<em>package</em>&gt;, &lt;<em>font</em>&gt; and &lt;<em>supplier</em>&gt; depend
upon what's appropriate for the individual file.  Note, however, that
&lt;<em>font</em>&gt; may stand for a single font or an entire family: for
example, files for all of Knuth's Computer Modern font family are to
be found in <code>.../public/cm</code>, with various prefixes as appropriate.
