<h3>Letters and the like</h3>
<p>LaTeX itself provides a <i>letter</i> document class, which is
widely disliked; the present author long since gave up trying with
it.  If you nevertheless want to try it, but are irritated by its way
of vertically-shifting a single-page letter, try the following hack:
<pre>
\makeatletter
\let\@texttop\relax
\makeatother
</pre>
in the preamble of your file.
<p>Doing-it-yourself is a common strategy; Knuth (for use with plain
TeX, in the TeXbook), and Kopka and Daly (in their Guide to
LaTeX) offer worked examples.
<p>Nevertheless, there <em>are</em> contributed alternatives - in fact
there are an awfully large number of them: the following list, of
necessity, makes but a small selection.
<p>The largest, most comprehensive, class is <i>newlfm</i>; the <code>lfm</code>
part of the name implies that the class can create letters, faxes and
memoranda.  The documentation is voluminous, and the package seems
very flexible.
<p>Axel Kielhorn's <i>akletter</i> class is the only other one,
recommended for inclusion in this FAQ, whose documentation is
available in English.
<p>The <i>dinbrief</i> class, while recommended, is only documented in
German.
<p>There are letter classes in each of the excellent
<i>koma-script</i> (<i>scrlettr</i>: documentation is available in
English) and <i>ntgclass</i> (<i>brief</i>: documentation in Dutch
only) bundles.  While these are probably good (since the bundles
themselves inspire trust) they've not been specifically recommended by
any users.
