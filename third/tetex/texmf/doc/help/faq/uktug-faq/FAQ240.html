<h3>Why can't I load PiCTeX?</h3>
<p>PiCTeX is a resource hog; fortunately, most modern TeX
implementations offer generous amounts of space, and most modern
computers are pretty fast, so users aren't too badly affected by its
performance.
<p>However, PiCTeX has the further unfortunate tendency to fill up
TeX's fixed-size arrays - notably the array of 256 'dimension'
registers.  This is a particular problem when you're using
<i>pictex.sty</i> with LaTeX and some other packages that also need
dimension registers.  When this happens, you will see the TeX error
message:
<pre>
  ! No room for a new \dimen.
</pre>
There is nothing that can directly be done about this error: you
can't extend the number of available <code>\dimen</code> registers without
extending TeX itself.
  (<a href="FAQ278.html">e-TeX</a> and <a href="FAQ277.html">Omega</a> both do this, as
  does MicroPress Inc's VTeX - see
  <a href="FAQ56.html">commercial implementations</a>.)



Since you can't (ordinarily) extend TeX, you need to change
PiCTeX; unfortunately PiCTeX's author is no longer active in the
TeX world, so one must resort to patching.  There are two solutions
available.
<p>The ConTeXt module <i>m-pictex.tex</i> (for Plain TeX and
variants) or the corresponding LaTeX <i>m-pictex</i> package provide
an ingenious solution to the problem based on hacking the code of
<code>\newdimen</code> itself.
<p>Alternatively, Andreas Schell's <i>pictexwd</i> and related
packages replace PiCTeX with a version that uses 33 fewer
<code>\dimen</code> registers; so use <i>pictexwd</i> in place of
<i>pictex</i> (either as a LaTeX package, or as a file to read
into Plain TeX).
<p>And how does one use PiCTeX anyway, given that the manual is so
hard to come by

(see <a href="FAQ33.html">the PiCTeX manual</a>)?
Fortunately for MSDOS and Windows users, the <i>MathsPic</i>
system may be used to translate a somewhat different language into
PiCTeX commands; and the <i>MathsPic</i> manual is free (and
part of the distribution).  <i>MathsPic</i> is written in
<i>Basic</i>; a version written in <i>Perl</i> is under
development, and should be available soon.
