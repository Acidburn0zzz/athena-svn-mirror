<h3>Quality of PDF from PostScript</h3>
<p>Any output of <i>dvips</i> may (in principle) be converted to
PDF, using either a sufficiently recent version of
<i>ghostscript</i> or Adobe's (commercial) <i>Distiller</i>,
but the results can be pretty poor if certain simple precautions are
omitted.
<p>First, it's important to use type 1 fonts in preparing the output;
Metafont bitmap fonts get converted to type 3 fonts when converting to
PDF, and Adobe's <i>Acrobat</i> <i>Reader</i> (which most of the
world uses to view PDF files) makes a very poor fist of
displaying type 3 fonts.  If you've written a document that uses
nothing but fonts such as Adobe Times, which only exist in type 1
format, no further action is actually required; however, most ordinary
(La)TeX documents contain at least odd characters that originate in
Metafont, and it's advisable to tell <i>dvips</i> to use type 1
versions regardless.  One does this by using the <i>dvips</i>
switches <code>-Pcmz</code> and <code>-Pamz</code>.
<p>Second, if you're using <i>ghostscript</i> (or the
<i>ps2pdf</i> script that's distributed with it) make sure you
have an appropriate version.  Again, if your document contains nothing
but the "basic PostScript" set of fonts (Times, etc), the
restrictions are less burdensome and you can get away with using
<i>ghostscript</i> version 5.50; however, that version makes
type 3 fonts of any type 1 fonts embedded in the PostScript, which is
pretty unsatisfactory.  To be safe, ensure that you're using
<i>ghostscript</i> version 6.00 at least (at the time of writing,
version 7.04 is current).
<p>Third, some versions of <i>Acrobat</i> <i>Reader</i> are confused by
characters that are in positions where Adobe fonts don't hold
characters, and most Metafont-supplied fonts have such characters (even
after they've been converted to type 1).  <i>Dvips</i> provides a
means for remapping these characters to places where they'll be
harmless; to invoke this facility, execute <i>dvips</i> with the
switch <code>-G1</code>
<p>Recent distributions of <i>dvips</i> come with a "<code>pdf</code>"
pseudo-printer description file; this bundles selection of the type 1
fonts and character remapping with setting a very high nominal printer
resolution, thus sidestepping <i>dvips</i>'s tendency to
'optimise' output destined for low-resolution printers.  Use this by
including the <code>-Ppdf</code> switch in your <i>dvips</i> command line.
