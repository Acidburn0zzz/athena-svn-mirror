<h3>The comma as a decimal separator</h3>
<p>If you use a comma in maths mode, you get a small space
after it; this space is inappropriate if the comma is being used
as a decimal separator.  An easy solution to this problem is to
type (in maths mode) <code>3{,}14</code> instead of typing <code>3,14</code>.
However, if your language's typographic rules require the comma as a
decimal separator, such usage can rapidly become extremely tiresome.
In such cases it is probably better to use the
<i>icomma</i> package.  The packages ensures that there will be no
extra space after a comma, unless you type a space after it (as in
<code>f(x, y)</code>, for instance), in which case the usual small space after
the comma appears.
