<h3>"Missing $ inserted"</h3>
<p>There are certain things that <em>only</em> work in maths mode.  If your
document is not in maths mode and you have an <code>_</code> or a <code>^</code> character,
TeX (and by inheritance, LaTeX too) will say
<pre>
! Missing $ inserted
</pre>
as if you couldn't possibly have misunderstood the import of what you
were typing, and the only possible interpretation is that you had
commited a typo in failing to enter maths mode.  TeX, therefore,
tries to patch things up by inserting the <code>$</code> you 'forgot', so that
the maths-only object will work; as often as not this will land you in
further confusion.
<p>It's not just the single-character maths sub- and superscript
operators: anything that's built in or declared as a maths operation,
from the simplest lower-case <code>\alpha</code> through the inscrutable
<code>\mathchoice</code> primitive, and beyond, will provoke the error if
misused in text mode.
<p>LaTeX offers a command <code>\ensuremath</code>, which will put you in maths
mode for the execution of its argument, if necessary: so if you want
an <code>\alpha</code> in your running text, say
<code>\ensuremath{<code>\alpha</code>}</code>; if the bit of running text somehow
transmutes into a bit of mathematics, the <code>\ensuremath</code> will become
a no-op, so it's pretty much always safe.
