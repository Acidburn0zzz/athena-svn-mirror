<h3>What is a driver?</h3>
<p>A driver is a program that takes as input a DVI file
(<a href="FAQ34.html">DVI files</a>)  and
(usually) produces a file that can be sent to a typographic
output device, called a printer for short.
<p>A driver will usually be specific to a particular printer,
although any PostScript printer ought to be able to print
the output from a PostScript driver.

<p>As well as the DVI file, the driver needs font information.
Font information may be held as bitmaps or as outlines, or simply as a
set of pointers into the fonts that the printer itself 'has'.
Each driver will expect the font information in
a particular form.  For more information on the forms of fonts,
see <a href="FAQ36.html"><code>pk</code> files</a>,

<a href="FAQ37.html"><code>tfm</code> files</a>,
<a href="FAQ38.html">virtual fonts</a>
and <a href="FAQ82.html">Using PostScript fonts with TeX</a>.
