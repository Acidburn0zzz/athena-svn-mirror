<h3>Documented LaTeX sources (<code>.dtx</code> files)</h3>
<p>LaTeX2e, and many support macro packages, are now written in a

<a href="FAQ65.html">literate programming</a> style,
with source and documentation in the
same file.  This format, known as 'doc', in fact originated before the
days of the LaTeX project as one of the "Mainz" series of
packages. The documented sources conventionally have the suffix
<code>.dtx</code>, and should normally be stripped of documentation
before use with LaTeX.  Alternatively you can run LaTeX on a
<code>.dtx</code> file to produce a nicely formatted version of the
documented code. An installation script (with suffix
<code>.ins</code>) is usually provided, which needs the standard LaTeX2e
<i>docstrip</i> package (among other things, the installation
process strips all the comments that make up the documentation for
speed when loading the file into a running LaTeX system).  Several
packages can be included in one <code>.dtx</code> file, with conditional
sections, and there facilities for indices of macros etc.  Anyone can
write <code>.dtx</code> files; the format is explained in
<em>The LaTeX Companion</em>

(see <a href="FAQ22.html">books on TeX</a>), and a tutorial is
available from CTAN (together with skeleton <code>.dtx</code> and
<code>.ins</code> files).  There are no programs yet to assist in
composition of <code>.dtx</code> files.
<p><code>.dtx</code> files are not used by LaTeX after they have been
processed to produce <code>.sty</code> or <code>.cls</code> (or whatever)
files.  They need not be kept with the working system; however, for
many packages the <code>.dtx</code> file is the primary source of
documentation, so you may want to keep <code>.dtx</code> files elsewhere.
