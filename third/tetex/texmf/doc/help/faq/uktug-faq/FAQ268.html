<h3>"Too many unprocessed floats"</h3>
<p>If LaTeX responds to a <code>\begin{figure}</code> or
<code>\begin{table}</code> command with the error message
<pre>
! LaTeX Error: Too many unprocessed floats.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
</pre>

your figures (or tables) are failing to be placed properly.  LaTeX
has a limited amount of storage for 'floats' (figures, tables, or
floats you've defined yourself with the <i>float</i> package); if
you don't let it ever actually typeset any floats, it will run out of
space.
<p>This failure usually occurs in extreme cases of


<a href="FAQ241.html">floats moving "wrongly"</a>;
LaTeX has found it can't place a float, and floats of the same type
have piled up behind it.  LaTeX's idea is to ensure that caption
numbers are sequential in the document: the caption number is
allocated when the figure (or whatever) is created, and can't be
changed, so that placement out of order would mean figure numbers
appearing out of order in the document (and in the list of figures, or
whatever).  So a simple failure to place a figure means that no
subsequent figure can be placed; and hence (eventually) the error.
<p>Techniques for solving the problem are discussed in the

<a href="FAQ241.html">floats question</a>
already referenced.
<p>The error also occurs in a
long sequence of <code>figure</code> or \environment{table}
environments, with no intervening
text.  Unless the environments will fit "here" (and you've allowed
them to go "here"), there will never be a page break, and so there
will never be an opportunity for LaTeX to reconsider placement.
(Of course, the floats can't all fit "here" if the sequence is
sufficiently polonged: once the page fills, LaTeX won't place any
more floats
Techniques for resolution may involve redefining the floats using the
<i>float</i> package's <code>[H]</code> float qualifier, but you are unlikely
to get away without using <code>\clearpage</code> from time to time.
