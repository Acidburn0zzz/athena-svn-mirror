<h3>Accented words aren't hyphenated</h3>
<p>TeX's algorithm for hyphenation gives up when it encounters an
<code>\accent</code> command; there are good reasons for this, but it means
that quality typesetting in non-English languages can be difficult.
<p>For TeX macro packages, you can avoiding the effect by using an
appropriately encoded font (for example, a Cork-encoded font - see
<a href="FAQ43.html">the EC fonts</a>) which contains accented
letters as single glyphs.  LaTeX users can achieve this end simply
by adding the command
<pre>
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
</pre>
to the preamble of their document.  Other encodings (notably
LY1, promoted by Y&amp;Y - see

<a href="FAQ56.html">commercial implementations</a>) may be used
in place of T1.  Indeed, most current 8-bit TeX font
encodings will 'work' with the relevant sets of hyphenation patterns. 
<p>In the future, perhaps,
<a href="FAQ277.html">Omega</a>
will provide a rather different solution.
