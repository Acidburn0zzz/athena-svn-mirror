<h3>The <i>NTS</i> project</h3>

<p>The <i>NTS</i> project was established in 1992, to produce a typesetting
system that's even better than TeX.  The project is not simply
enhancing TeX, for two reasons: first, that TeX itself has been
frozen by Knuth
(see <a href="FAQ18.html">the future of TeX</a>), and second,
even if they <em>were</em> allowed to develop the program, some members
of the <i>NTS</i> team feel that TeX in its present form is simply
unsuited to further development.  While all those involved in the
project are committed to TeX, they recognise
that the end product may very well have little in common with TeX
other than its philosophy.
<p>The group's first product was nevertheless a set of
extensions and enhancements to TeX, implemented through the standard
medium of a change-file.  The extended system is known e-TeX, and is
100textpercent
compatible with TeX; furthermore, e-TeX can construct a format
that <em>is</em> "TeX", with no extensions or enhancements present.
<p>The most recent base source of e-TeX (i.e., the Web change file) is
available on CTAN.  Implementations of e-TeX are also
distributed on the 
<a href="FAQ53.html">TeX Live CDROM</a>, and with most other modern
free TeX distributions.
<p>The project has now produced a beta-version of
TeX written (from scratch) in Java.  Since it <em>isn't</em> TeX
(it remains slightly incompatible in microscopic ways), it's known as
<i>NTS</i>.  As might be expected, this first re-implementation runs
rather slowly, but its operation <em>has</em> been demonstrated in
public, and the beta-release is available on
CTAN.
