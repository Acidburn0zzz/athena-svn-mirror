<h3>Formatting a thesis in LaTeX</h3>
<p>Thesis styles are usually very specific to your University, so it's
usually not profitable to ask around for a package outside your own
University.  Since many Universities (in their eccentric way) still
require double-spacing, you may care to refer to
<a href="FAQ145.html">the relevant question</a>.
If you want to write your own, a good place to start is the University
of California style, but it's not worth going to a lot of trouble. (If
officials won't allow standard typographic conventions, you won't be
able to produce an &aelig;sthetically pleasing document anyway!)
