<title>UK TeX FAQ -- question 199</title>
</head><body>
<h3>(Merely) peculiar hyphenation</h3>
<p>You may have found that TeX's famed automatic word-division does
not produce the break-points recommended by your dictionary. This may be
because TeX is set up for American English, whose rules for word
division (as specified, for example, in Webster's Dictionary) are
completely different from the British ones (as specified, for example,
in the Oxford Dictionaries). This problem is being addressed by the UK
TeX User community (see <i>Baskerville</i>, issue 4.4) but an entirely
satisfactory solution will take time; the current status is to be
found on CTAN (see

<a href="FAQ201.html">"using a new language"</a> for instructions
on adding this new "language").
