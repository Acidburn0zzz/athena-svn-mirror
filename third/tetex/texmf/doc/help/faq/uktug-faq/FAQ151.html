<h3>Code listings in LaTeX</h3>
<p>'Pretty' code listings are sometimes considered worthwhile by the
neurotically &aelig;sthetic programmer, but they have a serious place in
the typesetting of dissertations by computer science and other
students who are expected to write programs.  Simple verbatim listings
are commonly useful, as well.
<p>  <a href="FAQ149.html">Verbatim listings</a> are dealt with elsewhere.

'Pretty' listings are generally provided by means of a pre-compiler,
but the <i>listings</i> package manages to do the
job within LaTeX.
<p>The <i>lgrind</i> system is a well-established
pre-compiler, with all the facilities one might need and a wide
repertoire of languages.
<p>The <i>tiny_c2l</i> system is more recent:
users are encouraged to generate their own driver files for languages
it doesn't already deal with.
<p>The <i>C++2LaTeX</i> system comes
with strong recommendations for use with C and C++.
