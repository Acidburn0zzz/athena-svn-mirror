<h3>Capacity exceeded [semantic nest...]</h3>
<pre>
! TeX capacity exceeded, sorry [semantic nest
                                      size=100].
...
If you really absolutely need more capacity,
you can ask a wizard to enlarge me.
</pre>
Even though TeX suggests (as always) that enlargement by a wizard
may help, this message usually results from a broken macro or bad
parameters to an otherwise working macro.
<p>The "semantic nest" TeX talks about is the nesting
of boxes within boxes.  A stupid macro can provoke the error pretty
easily:
<pre>
\def\silly{\hbox{here's \silly being executed}}
\silly
</pre>
The extended traceback

(<a href="FAQ261.html">see <em>general advice</em> on errors</a>)
<em>does</em> help, though it does rather run on.  In the case above,
the traceback consists of
<pre>
\silly -&gt;\hbox {
                here's \silly being executed}
</pre>
followed by 100 instances of
<pre>
\silly -&gt;\hbox {here's \silly 
                              being executed}
</pre>
The repeated lines are broken at exactly the offending macro; of
course the loop need not be as simple as this - if <code>\silly</code> calls
<code>\dopy</code> which boxes <code>\silly</code>, the effect is just the same and
alternate lines in the traceback are broken at alternate positions.
