<h3>Missing symbol commands</h3>
<p>You're processing an old document, and some symbol commands such as
<code>\Box</code> and <code>\lhd</code> appear no longer to exist.  These commands were
present in the core of LaTeX 2.09, but are not in current LaTeX.
They are available in the <i>latexsym</i> package (which is part of
the LaTeX distribution), and in the <i>amsfonts</i> package
(which is part of the AMS distribution, and requires AMS
symbol fonts).
