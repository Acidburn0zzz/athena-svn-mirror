<H2><A NAME="QU115">The New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS)</A></H2>

<P>
NFSS was an extension to LaTeX written by Frank Mittelbach and
Rainer Sch&ouml;pf. It is described in <CITE>TUGboat</CITE> 10(2).  In
traditional typesetting, fonts are described by four parameters: the
<EM>family</EM> (<EM>e.g</EM>., computer modern), the <EM>series</EM>
(<EM>i.e</EM>., the weight and width of the font, such as light or bold),
the <EM>shape</EM> (<EM>e.g</EM>., italic), and the <EM>size</EM>. NFSS is a
mechanism allowing the user to change any of these independently. NFSS
makes it relatively easy to use nonstandard fonts such as the
PostScript ones with LaTeX, and easy to change maths fonts.  It
also allows dynamic loading of fonts at runtime (<EM>i.e</EM>., not when
the format file is created).

<P>
With the demise of LaTeX 2.09 as supported software, the label
`NFSS' has become somewhat misleading, as there's no `old' scheme with
which to contrast it - LaTeX has incorporated the NFSS.


<H2><A NAME="QU116">LaTeX2e (the `new' standard LaTeX)</A></H2>

<P>
LaTeX2e is the version of LaTeX prepared and supported by the
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU117">LaTeX3 project team</A>.
With the advent of LaTeX2e, users gained a formal support structure,
and the knowledge that bug fixes would be incorporated into the
distribution on a fairly regular basis (new releases appear at
approximately 6-month intervals).

<P>
LaTeX2e is so structured that significant enhancements may be added
using macro add-ons, rather than by the different TeX formats that
were the bane of the LaTeX 2.09 world.

<P>
LaTeX2e is upwardly compatible with LaTeX 2.09, but has new
features.  In the latest (December 1998) release, these include:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU115">NFSS</A>
  is part of the distribution.
<LI> SliTeX is now merely a different document class, so that
  there is no longer a need for a separate format.
<LI> Better control of floating environments, such as figures.
<LI> There is a documented interface for package and class writers
  (though not yet for designers).
<LI> The box commands have been enhanced, with <EM>e.g.</EM>, options to
  specify the height of a minipage.
<LI> Several standard commands are no longer
  <A HREF="texfaq_15.html#QU110">fragile</A>
  they can therefore be included in the argument of commands such as
  <CODE>\caption</CODE> without being protected.
<LI> <CODE>\newcommand</CODE> can define commands with one optional argument;
  such commands are automatically robust.
<LI> There is now a standard package for colour and graphics
  inclusion.
<LI> There is standard support for typesetting in cyrillic.
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="QU117">The LaTeX3 project</A></H2>

<P>
The LaTeX3 project team (see <A HREF="http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html"><TT>http://www.latex-project.org/latex3.html</TT></A>)
is a small group of volunteers whose aim is
to produce a major new document processing system based on the
principles pioneered by Leslie Lamport in the current LaTeX.  It
will remain freely available and it will be fully documented at
all levels.

<P>
The LaTeX3 team's first product,
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU116">LaTeX2e</A>,
was delivered in 1994, and the team undertakes its maintenance.



<H2><A NAME="QU118">The Omega project</A></H2>

<P>
Omega
is a program built as an extension of the TeX sources which works
internally with 16-bit
characters (Unicode); this allows it to work with most scripts in the
world with much reduced coding scheme complications.  Omega also has a
powerful concept of input and output filters to allow the user to work
with existing transliteration schemes, <EM>etc</EM>.  Omega is an
ongoing project by John Plaice (<SAMP>plaice@cse.unsw.edu.au</SAMP>) and
Yannis Haralambous (<SAMP>Yannis.Haralambous@univ-lille1.fr</SAMP>).  An
email discussion list is available: subscribe by sending a message
`<CODE>subscribe omega &lt;</CODE><EM><CODE>your name</CODE></EM><CODE>&gt;</CODE>' to <A HREF="mailto://listserv@ens.fr"><TT>listserv@ens.fr</TT></A>

<P>
The base distribution of
  Omega
was released in November 1996; it is available via <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/omega"><TT>systems/omega</TT></A>

<P>
Implementations of Omega are available as part of the teTeX,
mikTeX, fpTeX and CMacTeX distributions
(see the question on <A HREF="texfaq_5.html#QU38">TeX systems</A>).



<H2><A NAME="QU119">The NTS project</A></H2>

<P>
The NTS project first saw the light of day at the Hamburg meeting
of DANTE during 1992, as a response to an aspiration to
produce something even better than TeX.  The project is not simply
enhancing TeX, for two reasons: first, that TeX itself has been
frozen by Knuth
(see <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU15">the future of TeX</A>), and second,
even if they <EM>were</EM> allowed to develop the program, some members
of the NTS team feel that TeX in its present form is simply
unsuited to further development.  While all those involved in the
project are involved with, and committed to, TeX, they recognise
that the end product may very well have little in common with TeX
other than its philosophy.

<P>
Initially, and despite the reservations expressed at the inaugural meeting,
the group is concentrating on extending TeX <EM>per se</EM>: members are
implementing extensions and enhancements to TeX through the standard
medium of a change-file.  These extensions and enhancements, together
with TeX proper, form a system called e-TeX, which is 100%
compatible with TeX; furthermore, it is possible during format
creation to construct a format that <EM>is</EM> TeX: no extensions or
enhancements are present.

<P>
The final aim of the project will be to produce an entirely new
typesetting system, building on the experience gained in the earlier
phases.  This system is intended to provide a stable basis
for typesetting in the future, in the way that TeX has since it was
first offered to the world.

<P>
A distribution of e-TeX was made available in November 1996.  It is
available via <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/e-tex"><TT>systems/e-tex</TT></A>; e-TeX is also distributed on the
TeX Live CD-ROM
(see <A HREF="texfaq_4.html#QU37">TeX CD-ROMs</A>).


<H2><A NAME="QU120">The PDFTeX project</A></H2>

<P>
PDFTeX (formerly known as TeX2PDF) arose from Han
The Thanh's post-graduate research at Masaryk University, Brno, Czech
Republic.  The basic idea is very simple: to provide a version of
TeX that can output PDF as an alternative format to
DVI.  PDFTeX implements a small number of new
primitives, to switch to PDF output, and to control various
PDF features.  Han The Thanh is continuing work on the project;
the latest version is available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/pdftex"><TT>systems/pdftex</TT></A>, and a version
was distributed on the TeX Live CD-ROM
(see <A HREF="texfaq_4.html#QU37">TeX CD-ROMs</A>).
