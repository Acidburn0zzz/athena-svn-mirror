<h3>Installing MikTeX "known packages"</h3>
<p>MikTeX 2.1 maintains a database of packages it "knows about",
together with (coded) installation instructions that enable it to
install with with minimal user intervention.
<p>If MikTeX does know about a package you need installed, it's worth
using the system.
<p>First, open the MikTeX packages window: click on
  <code>Start</code>-&gt; 
  <code>Programs</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MikTeX</code>-&gt; 
  <code>MikTeX Options</code>, and select the
  <code>Packages</code> tab.
<p>On the tab, there is an Explorer-style display of packages.
Right-click on the root of the tree, "<code>MikTeX Packages</code>",
and select "<code>Search</code>": enter the name of the package you're
interested in, and press the "<code>Search</code>" button.  If
MikTeX knows about your package, it will open up the tree to show
you a tick box for you package: check that box.
<p>If MikTeX <em>doesn't</em> know about the package you're interested
in, you have to use the 
<a href="FAQ112.html">long-winded procedure</a> outlined
elsewhere in this FAQ.
<p>If necessary, repeat to select other packages, and then press
"<code>OK</code>"; MikTeX tells you how many packages you have
selected - if you're happy, press "<code>OK</code>" again.
MikTeX will go off, download the package (as a
<code>.cab</code> file), if necessary, install the files of the package, and then
refresh the filename database so that the files will be found.
