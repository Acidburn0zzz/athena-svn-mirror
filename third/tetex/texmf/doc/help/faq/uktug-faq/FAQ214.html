<h3>How to get copyright, trademark, etc.</h3>
<p>The "
<a href="FAQ32.html">Comprehensive symbol list</a>", lists
the symbol commands <code>\textcopyright</code>,
<code>\textregistered</code> and <code>\texttrademark</code>, which are available in
TS1-encoded fonts, and which are enabled using the
<i>textcomp</i> package.
<p>In fact, all three commands are enabled in default LaTeX, but the
glyphs you get aren't terribly beautiful.  In particular,
<code>\textregistered</code> behaves oddly when included in bold text (for
example, in a section heading), since it is composed of a small-caps
letter, which typically degrades to a regular shape letter when asked
to set in a bold font.  This means that the glyph becomes a circled
"r", whereas the proper symbol is a circled "R".
<p>This effect is of course avoided by use of <i>textcomp</i>.
<p>Another problem arises if you want <code>\textregistered</code> in a
superscript position (to look similar to <code>\texttrademark</code>).
Using a maths-mode superscript to do this provokes lots of pointless
errors: you <em>must</em> use
<pre>
  \textsuperscript{\textregistered}
</pre>
