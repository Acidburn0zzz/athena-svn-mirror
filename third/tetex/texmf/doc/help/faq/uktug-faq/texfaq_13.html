<H1><A NAME="SEC13">How do I do <CITE>X</CITE> in TeX or LaTeX</A></H1>


<H2><A NAME="QU78">Proof environment</A></H2>

<P>
It is not possible to make a <CODE>proof</CODE> environment which automatically
includes an `end-of-proof' symbol. Some proofs end in displayed maths;
others do not. If the input file contains <CODE>...\] \end{proof}</CODE> then
LaTeX finishes off the displayed maths and gets ready for a new
line before it reads any instructions connected with ending the proof.
But traditionally the end-of-proof sign goes in the display, not on a
new line. So you just have to put it in by hand in every proof.


<H2><A NAME="QU79">Symbols for the number sets</A></H2>

<P>
It is a good idea to have commands such as <CODE>\R</CODE> for the real numbers and
other standard number sets. Traditionally these were typeset in bold.
Because mathematicians usually do not have access to bold chalk, they
invented the special symbols that are now often used for <CODE>\R</CODE>, <CODE>\C</CODE>,
<EM>etc</EM>.  These symbols are known as ``blackboard bold''. Before
insisting on using them, consider whether going back to the old system
of ordinary bold might not be acceptable (it is certainly simpler).

<P>
A set of blackboard bold capitals is available in the AMS fonts
``msam'' (<EM>e.g.</EM>, ``msam10'' for 10pt) and ``msbm''. The fonts
have a large number of mathematical symbols to supplement the ones in
the standard TeX distribution. The fonts are available in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/ams/amsfonts/sources/symbols"><TT>fonts/ams/amsfonts/sources/symbols</TT></A>

<P>
Two files which load the fonts and define the symbols are provided,
and both work with either TeX or LaTeX.  Questions or
suggestions regarding these fonts should be directed to
<SAMP>tech-support@math.ams.org</SAMP>.

<P>
Another complete set of blackboard bold fonts, the bbold family, is
available in METAFONT (in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/bbold"><TT>fonts/bbold</TT></A>).  This set has the interesting
property of offering blackboard bold forms of lower-case letters,
something rather rarely seen on actual blackboards.

<P>
The ``lazy person's'' blackboard bold macros:
<PRE>
  \newcommand{\R}{{\sf R\hspace*{-0.9ex}%
    \rule{0.15ex}{1.5ex}\hspace*{0.9ex}}}
  \newcommand{\N}{{\sf N\hspace*{-1.0ex}%
    \rule{0.15ex}{1.3ex}\hspace*{1.0ex}}}
  \newcommand{\Q}{{\sf Q\hspace*{-1.1ex}%
    \rule{0.15ex}{1.5ex}\hspace*{1.1ex}}}
  \newcommand{\C}{{\sf C\hspace*{-0.9ex}%
    \rule{0.15ex}{1.3ex}\hspace*{0.9ex}}}
</PRE>
<P>
work well at normal size if the surrounding text is <CODE>cmr10</CODE>. However, 
they are not part of a proper maths font, and so do not work in sub- and 
superscripts. Moreover, the size and position of the vertical bar is 
affected by the font of the surrounding text.


<H2><A NAME="QU80">Roman theorems</A></H2>

<P>
If you want to take advantage of the powerful <CODE>\newtheorem</CODE> command
without the constraint that the contents of the theorem is in a sloped
font (for example, to use it to create remarks, examples, proofs,
...) then you can use the style file <TT>theorem.sty</TT> (part of
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>). Alternatively, the following sets up an
environment <CODE>remark</CODE> whose content is in roman.
<PRE>
  \newtheorem{preremark}{Remark}
  \newenvironment{remark}%
    {\begin{preremark}\rm}{\end{preremark}}
</PRE>
<P>
This will not work if you are using
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU115">NFSS</A> outside of <A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU116">LaTeX2e</A>,
because the command <CODE>\rm</CODE> behaves differently there.



<H2><A NAME="QU81">Fancy enumeration lists</A></H2>

<P>
Suppose you want your top-level <CODE>enumerate</CODE>s to be labelled `I/', `II/',
..., then give these commands:
<PRE>
   \renewcommand{\theenumi}{\Roman{enumi}}
   \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\theenumi/}
</PRE>
<P>
The possible styles of numbering are given in Section 6.3 of Lamport's
book (see <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">TeX-related books</A>).  Both
<CODE>\theenumi</CODE> and <CODE>\labelenumi</CODE> must be changed, since
<CODE>\theenumi</CODE> is used in cross-references to the list.

<P>
For lower level <CODE>enumerate</CODE>s, replace <CODE>enumi</CODE> by <CODE>enumii</CODE>, <CODE>enumiii</CODE>
or <CODE>enumiv</CODE>, according to the level.  If your label is much larger
than the default, you should also change <CODE>\leftmargini</CODE>,
<CODE>\leftmarginii</CODE>, <EM>etc</EM>.

<P>
If you're running LaTeX2e, the package <TT>enumerate.sty</TT> (part of
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>) offers similar facilities.  With
<TT>enumerate.sty</TT>, the example above would
be achieved simply by starting the enumeration
<CODE>\begin{enumerate}[I/]</CODE>.


<H2><A NAME="QU82">Unnumbered sections in the Table of Contents</A></H2>

<P>
The easiest way to get headings of funny `sections' such as
prefaces in  the table of contents is to use the
counter <CODE>secnumdepth</CODE> described in Appendix C of the LaTeX 
manual. For example:
<PRE>
    \setcounter{secnumdepth}{-1}
    \chapter{Preface}
</PRE>
<P>
Of course, you have to set <CODE>secnumdepth</CODE> back to its usual value
(which is 2 in the standard styles) before you do
any `section' which you want to be numbered.

<P>
Similar settings are made automatically in the LaTeX book class by
the <CODE>\frontmatter</CODE> and <CODE>\backmatter</CODE> commands.

<P>
This is why it works. 
<CODE>\chapter</CODE> without the star does
<OL>
<LI> put something in the <CODE>.toc</CODE> file;
<LI> if the <CODE>secnumdepth</CODE> counter is greater than or equal to zero,
      increase the counter for the chapter and write it out.
<LI> write the chapter title.
</OL>
Other sectioning commands are similar, but with other values 
used in the test.


<H2><A NAME="QU83">Footnotes in tables</A></H2>
The standard LaTeX <CODE>\footnote</CODE> command doesn't work in tables; the table
traps the footnotes and they can't escape to the bottom of the page.

<P>
If your table is floating, your best bet is (unfortunately) to put the
table in a <CODE>minipage</CODE> environment and to put the notes
underneath the table, or to use Donald Arseneau's package
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/threeparttable.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/threeparttable.sty</TT></A>

<P>
Otherwise, if your table is not floating (it's just a
`<CODE>tabular</CODE>' in the middle of some text), there are several
things you can do to fix the problem.
<OL>
<LI> Use <CODE>\footnotemark</CODE> to position the little marker
  appropriately, and then put in <CODE>\footnotetext</CODE> commands to fill in
  the text once you've closed the tabular environment.  This is
  described in Lamport's book, but it gets messy if there's more than
  one footnote.
<LI> Stick the table in a <CODE>minipage</CODE> anyway.  This provides
  all the ugliness of footnotes in a minipage with no extra effort.
<LI> Use <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/threeparttable.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/threeparttable.sty</TT></A> anyway;
  the package is intended for floating tables, and the result might
  look odd if the table is not floating, but it will be reasonable.
<LI> Use <TT>tabularx</TT> or <TT>longtable</TT> from the LaTeX tools
  distribution (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>); they're noticeably less
  efficient than the standard <CODE>tabular</CODE> environment, but they
  do allow footnotes.
<LI> Grab hold of <TT>footnote.sty</TT> from CTAN, lurking in
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools</TT></A>

<P>
  Then put your tabular environment inside a <CODE>savenotes</CODE>
  environment.  Alternatively, say <CODE>\makesavenoteenv{tabular}</CODE> in
  the preamble of your document, and tables will all handle footnotes
  correctly.
<LI> Use <TT>mdwtab.sty</TT> from the same directory
  (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools</TT></A>).

<P>
  This will handle footnotes properly, and has other facilities to
  increase the beauty of your tables.  It may also cause other
  table-related packages (not the standard `tools' ones, though) to
  become very unhappy and stop working.
</OL>


<H2><A NAME="QU84">Style of section headings</A></H2>

<P>
Suppose that the editor of your favourite journal has specified that section
headings must be centred, in small capitals, and subsection headings ragged 
right in italic, but that you don't want to get involved in the sort of
programming described in <EM>The LaTeX Companion</EM>
  (see <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">TeX-related books</A>; the
  <A HREF="texfaq_14.html#QU104">programming</A> itself is discussed under `@').
The following hack will 
probably satisfy your editor. Define yourself new commands
<PRE>
  \newcommand{\ssection}[1]{%
     \section[#1]{\centering\sc #1}}
  \newcommand{\ssubsection}[1]{%
     \subsection[#1]{\raggedright\it #1}}
</PRE>
<P>
and then use <CODE>\ssection</CODE> and <CODE>\ssubsection</CODE> in place of 
<CODE>\section</CODE> and <CODE>\subsection</CODE>. This isn't perfect: section numbers 
remain in bold, and starred forms need a separate redefinition. Also, 
this will not work if you are using 
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU115">NFSS</A> outside of <A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU116">LaTeX2e</A>,
because the font-changing commands behave differently there.


<H2><A NAME="QU85">Indent after section headings</A></H2>

<P>
LaTeX implements a style that doesn't indent the first paragraph
after a section heading.  There are coherent reasons for this, but not
everyone likes it.
The package <TT>indentfirst.sty</TT> (part of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>)
suppresses the mechanism, so that the first paragraph is
indented.


<H2><A NAME="QU86">Footnotes in LaTeX section headings</A></H2>

<P>
The <CODE>\footnote</CODE> command is fragile, so that simply placing the
command in <CODE>\section</CODE>'s arguments isn't satisfactory.  Using
<CODE>\protect</CODE><CODE>\footnote</CODE> isn't a good idea either: the arguments of a
section command are used in the table of contents and (more
dangerously) potentially also in page headings.  Unfortunately,
there's no mechanism to suppress the footnote in the heading while
allowing it in the table of contents, though having footnotes in the
table of contents is probably unsatisfactory anyway.

<P>
To suppress the footnote in headings and table of contents:
<UL>
<LI> Take advantage of the fact that the mandatory argument doesn't
  `move' if the optional argument is present:
  <CODE>\section[title]{title</CODE><CODE>\footnote</CODE><CODE>{title footnote}}</CODE>
<LI> Use the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/footmisc"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/footmisc</TT></A> package, with package option
  <CODE>stable</CODE> -this modifies footnotes so that they softly and silently
  vanish away if used in a moving argument.
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="QU87">Changing the margins in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
Don't do it. Learn some LaTeX, produce some 
documents, and then ask again. 

<P>
You can never change the  <EM>margins</EM> of a document by software, 
because they depend on the actual size of the paper.  What you can change 
are the distances from the apparent top and left edges of the paper, 
and the width and height of the text. Changing the last two requires 
more skill than you might expect. The height should bear a certain 
relationship to <CODE>\baselineskip</CODE>. And the width should not be more 
than 75 characters. Lamport's warning in his section on 
`Customizing the Style' really must be taken seriously. One-inch 
margins on A4 paper are fine for 10- or 12-pitch typewriters, but not 
for 10pt type (or even 11pt or 12pt) because so many 
characters per line will irritate the reader.  However...

<P>
Perhaps the easiest way to get more out of a page in LaTeX is to
get <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex209/contrib/misc/fullpage.sty"><TT>macros/latex209/contrib/misc/fullpage.sty</TT></A>, which sets the margins of the page identical
to those of <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX, <EM>i.e.</EM>, 1-inch margins at all four
sides of the
paper. It also contains an adjustment for A4 paper.

<P>
Somewhat more flexible is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/vmargin.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/vmargin.sty</TT></A>, which has a canned set of
paper sizes (a superset of that provided in LaTeX2e), provision for
custom paper, margin adjustments and provision for two-sided printing.

<P>
For details of LaTeX's page
parameters, see section C.5.3 of the
LaTeX manual (pp. 181-182).
The origin in DVI coordinates is one inch
from the top of the paper and one inch from the left side; positive
horizontal measurements extend
right across the page, and positive vertical measurements extend down
the page. Thus, for margins closer to the left and top edges of the
page than 1 inch, the corresponding parameters, <EM>i.e</EM>.,
<CODE>\evensidemargin</CODE>, <CODE>\oddsidemargin</CODE>, <CODE>\topmargin</CODE>, can be set to
negative values.

<P>
You cannot simply change the margins of part of a document within the
document by
modifying the parameters shown in Lamport's figure C.3. They
should only be changed in the preamble of the document, <EM>i.e</EM>., before
the <CODE>\begin{document}</CODE> statement. To adjust the margins within a
document we define an environment:
<PRE>
\newenvironment{changemargin}[2]{%
 \begin{list}{}{%
  \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}%
  \setlength{\leftmargin}{#1}%
  \setlength{\rightmargin}{#2}%
  \setlength{\listparindent}{\parindent}%
  \setlength{\itemindent}{\parindent}%
  \setlength{\parsep}{\parskip}%
 }%
\item[]}{\end{list}}
</PRE>
<P>
This environment takes two arguments, and will indent the left
and right margins by their values, respectively. Negative values
will cause the margins to be narrowed, so
<CODE>\begin{changemargin}{-1cm}{-1cm}</CODE> narrows the left and right margins
by 1cm.


<H2><A NAME="QU88">Finding the width of a letter, word, or phrase</A></H2>

<P>
Put the word in a box, and measure the width of the box. For example,
<PRE>
  \newdimen\stringwidth
  \setbox0=\hbox{hi}
  \stringwidth=\wd0
</PRE>
<P>
Note that if the quantity in the <CODE>\hbox</CODE> is a phrase, the actual
measurement only approximates the width that the phrase will occupy in
running text, since the inter-word glue can be adjusted in paragraph
mode.

<P>
The same sort of thing is expressed in LaTeX by:
<PRE>
  \newlength{\gnat}
  \settowidth{\gnat}{\textbf{small}}
</PRE>
<P>
This sets the value of the length command <CODE>\gnat</CODE> to the width of ``small''
in bold-face text.


<H2><A NAME="QU89">Excluding blocks of text from the DVI file</A></H2>

<P>
Rainer Sch&ouml;pf's <TT>verbatim.sty</TT> provides a comment environment which
excludes everything between <CODE>\begin</CODE><CODE>{comment}</CODE> and <CODE>\end</CODE><CODE>{comment}</CODE>. 
This package is available as part of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>

<P>
A more general environment for doing the job is Victor Eijkhout's
<TT>comment.sty</TT>, which lets you define environments for inclusion
or exclusion in a document, thus offering a primitive configuration
structure.  It is available from the CTAN sites in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex209/contrib/misc/comment.sty"><TT>macros/latex209/contrib/misc/comment.sty</TT></A>


<H2><A NAME="QU90">Setting bold Greek letters in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
The simple solution (<CODE>\mathbf</CODE>) doesn't always work, because
lower-case Greek letters behave differently from upper-case Greek
letters (due to Knuth's esoteric font encoding decisions).  However,
<CODE>\mathbf</CODE> <EM>can</EM> be used for upper-case Greek letters in
ordinary circumstances, but the AMS-LaTeX package <TT>amsmath.sty</TT>
disables this font-switching and you must use one of the techniques
outlined below.

<P>
The plain TeX solution <EM>does</EM> work, in a limited way:
<PRE>
  {\boldmath$\theta$}
</PRE>
<P>
but <CODE>\boldmath</CODE> may not be used in maths mode, so this `solution'
requires arcana such as:
<PRE>
  $... \mbox{\boldmath$\theta$} ...$
</PRE>
<P>
which then causes problems in superscripts, etc.

<P>
These problems may be addressed by using a bold mathematics package.
<UL>
<LI> The package <CODE>bm.sty</CODE>, which is part of the LaTeX tools
  distribution (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>), defines a command <CODE>\bm</CODE> which
  may be used anywhere in maths mode.
<LI> The package <CODE>amsbsy.sty</CODE>, which is part of AMS-LaTeX
  (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex"><TT>macros/latex/required/amslatex</TT></A>) defines a command <CODE>\boldsymbol</CODE>, which
  (though slightly less comprehensive than <CODE>\bm</CODE>) covers almost all
  common cases.
</UL>

<P>
All these solutions cover all mathematical symbols, not merely Greek
letters.


<H2><A NAME="QU91">Defining a new log-like function in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
Use the <CODE>\mathop</CODE> command, as in:
<PRE>
  \newcommand{\diag}{\mathop{\rm diag}}
</PRE>

<P>
Subscripts and superscripts on <CODE>\diag</CODE> will be placed exactly as they
are on <CODE>\lim</CODE>.  If you want your subscripts and superscripts always
placed to the right, do:
<PRE>
\newcommand{\diag}{\mathop{\rm diag}\nolimits}
</PRE>

<P>
This works in LaTeX 2.09 and in LaTeX2e, but not under NFSS alone
(see <A HREF="texfaq_14.html#QU100">problems with <CODE>\rm</CODE>, etc.</A>).
However, the canonical method for doing this in LaTeX2e is to use
the the <CODE>\DeclareMathOperator</CODE> command of <CODE>amsopn.sty</CODE> (which is
part of the AMS-LaTeX package: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex"><TT>macros/latex/required/amslatex</TT></A>).

<P>
(It should be noted that ``log-like'' was reportedly a <EM>joke</EM> on
Lamport's part; it is of course clear what was meant.)


<H2><A NAME="QU92">Typesetting all those TeX-related logos</A></H2>

<P>
Knuth was making a particular point about the capabilities of TeX
when he defined the logo.  Unfortunately, many
believe, he thereby opened floodgates to
give the world logos such as AMS-TeX, PicTeX, BibTeX, and so on.
Lamport invented LaTeX, and marketing input led to
the current logo LaTeX2e.

<P>
The common people don't have to follow this stuff wherever it goes,
but, for those who insist, a large collection of logos is defined in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/eplain/texnames.sty"><TT>macros/eplain/texnames.sty</TT></A>; the METAFONT logo can be set in fonts that LaTeX2e
knows about (so that it scales with the surrounding text) using the
package <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mflogo"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/mflogo</TT></A>

<P>
For those who don't wish to acquire the `proper' logos, the canonical
thing to do is to say <CODE>AMS-\TeX{}</CODE> (AMS-TeX) for AMS-TeX,
<CODE>Pic\TeX{}</CODE> (PicTeX) for PicTeX, <CODE>Bib\TeX{}</CODE> (BibTeX) for
BibTeX, and so on.
