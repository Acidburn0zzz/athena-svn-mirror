<h3>Typesetting the Euro sign</h3>
<p>The European currency "Euro" is represented by a symbol of somewhat
dubious design, but it's an important currency and (La)TeX users
need to typeset it.
<p>Note that the Commission of the European Community at first deemed
that the Euro symbol should always be set in a sans-serif font;
fortunately, this eccentric ruling has now been rescinded, and one may
apply best typesetting efforts to making it appear at least slightly
"respectable" (typographically).
<p>The TS1-encoded fonts provided as part of the EC font
distribution provide Euro glyphs.  The fonts are called Text Companion
(TC) fonts, and offer the same range
of faces as do the EC fonts themselves.  The
<i>textcomp</i> package provides a <code>\texteuro</code> command for
accessing the symbol, which selects a symbol to match the surrounding
text.  The design of the symbol in the TC fonts is not
universally loved...
Nevertheless, use the TC font version of the symbol if you are
producing documents using Knuth's Computer Modern Fonts.
<p>The <i>latin9</i> input encoding defined by the <i>inputenc</i>
package has a euro character defined (character position 164, occupied
in other ISO Latin character sets by the "currency symbol").
The encoding uses the command <code>\texteuro</code> for the character; at
present that command is <em>only</em> available from the
<i>textcomp</i> package.  There is a MicroSoft code page position,
too, but standardisation of such things proceeds via rather different
routes and the LaTeX project hasn't yet been given details of the
change.
<p>Outline fonts which contain nothing but Euro symbols are available
(free) from
<a href="ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/type/win/all/eurofont.exe">Adobe</a> -
the file is packaged as a <i>Windows</i> self-extracting
executable, but it may be decoded as a <code>.zip</code> format achive on other
operating systems.
The <i>euro</i> bundle contains metrics, <i>dvips</i> map
files, and macros (for Plain TeX and LaTeX), for using these
fonts in documents.  LaTeX users will find two packages in the
bundle: <i>eurosans</i> only offers the sans-serif version (to
conform with the obsolete ruling about sans-serif-only symbols; the
package provides the
command <code>\euro</code>), whereas <i>europs</i> matches the Euro symbol
with the surrounding text (providing the command <code>\EUR</code>).  To use
either package
with the <i>latin9</i> encoding, you need to define <code>\texteuro</code>
as an alias for the euro command the package defines.
<p>The Adobe fonts are probably the best bet for use in non-Computer
Modern environments.  They are apparently designed to fit with Adobe
Times, Helvetica and Courier, but can probably fit with a wider range
of modern fonts.
<p>The <i>eurofont</i> package provides a compendious analysis of the
"problem of the euro symbol" in its documentation, and offers macros
for configuring the source of the glyphs to be used; however, it seems
rather large for everyday use.
<p>The <i>euro-ce</i> bundle is a rather pleasing Metafont-only design
providing Euro symbols in a number of shapes.  The file
<i>euro-ce.tex</i>, in the distribution, offers hints as to how a
Plain TeX user might make use of the fonts.
<p>Euro symbols are found in several other places, which we list here for
completeness.
<p>The <i>marvosym</i> fonts contain a Euro symbol among many other
good things; the font on CTAN is not Adobe <i>ATM</i>
compatible, but a compatible version is available free from
<a href="http://www.YandY.com/download/marvosym.zip">Y&amp;Y</a>.  The font
on CTAN comes with a set of macros to typeset all the symbols
it contains.
<p>Other Metafont-based bundles containing Euro symbols are to be found in
<i>china2e</i> (whose primary aim is Chinese dates and suchlike
matters) and the <i>eurosym</i> fonts.
