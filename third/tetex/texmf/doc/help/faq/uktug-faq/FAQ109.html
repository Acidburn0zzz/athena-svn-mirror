<h3>References from the bibliography to the citation</h3>
<p>A link (or at least a page reference), from the bibliography to the
citing command, is often useful in large documents.
<p>Two packages support this requirement, <i>backref</i> and
<i>citeref</i>.  <i>Backref</i> is part of the
<i>hyperref</i> bundle, and supports hyperlinks back to the citing
command.  <i>Citeref</i> is the older, and seems to rely on rather
simpler (and therefore possibly more stable) code.  Neither collapses
lists of pages ("<code>5, 6, 7</code>" comes out as such, rather than as
"<code>5-7</code>"), but neither package repeats the reference to a page that
holds multiple citations.  (The failure to collapse lists is of course
forgiveable in the case of the <i>hyperref</i>-related
<i>backref</i>, since the concept of multiple hyperlinks from the
same anchor is less than appealing.)
