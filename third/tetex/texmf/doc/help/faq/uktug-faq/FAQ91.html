<h3>Graphics in PDFLaTeX</h3>
<p>PDFTeX itself has a rather wide range of formats that it can
"natively" incorporate into its output PDF stream:
JPEG (<code>.jpg</code> files) for photographs and similar images,
TIFF (<code>.tif</code> files) and PNG files for artificial bitmap
images, and PDF for vector drawings.
<p>In addition, the standard PDFLaTeX <i>graphics</i> package setup
causes Hans Hagen's <i>supp-pdf</i> macros to be loaded: these macros
are capable of translating the output of MetaPost to PDF "on the
fly"; thus MetaPost output (<code>.mps</code> files) may also be included in
PDFLaTeX documents.
<p>The commonest problem users encounter, when switching from TeX, is
that there is no straightforward way to include EPS files:
since PDFTeX is its own "driver", and since it contains no means
of converting PostScript to PDF, there's no direct way the job can
be done.
<p>The simple solution is to convert the EPS to an appropriate
PDF file.  The <i>epstopdf</i> program will do this: it's
available either as a Windows executable or as a <i>Perl</i>
script to run on Unix and other similar systems.  A LaTeX package,
<i>epstopdf</i>, can be used to generate the requisite PDF
files "on the fly"; this is convenient, but requires that you
suppress one of TeX's security checks: don't use it in files from
sources you don't entirely trust.
<p>An alternative (and, I find, deeply satisfying) solution is to use
<i>purifyeps</i>, a <i>perl</i> script which uses the good
offices of <i>pstoedit</i> and of MetaPost to convert your
Encapsulated PostScript to "Encapsulated PostScript that comes out of MetaPost",
and can therefore be included directly.
