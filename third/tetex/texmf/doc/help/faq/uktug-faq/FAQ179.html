<h3>Placing two-column floats at bottom of page</h3>
<p>You specified placement '<code>[htbp]</code>' for your full-width figure or
table, but they always get placed at the top of the page...  Well,
it <em>is</em> what the documentation says: LaTeX, unadorned, only
allows full-width floats at the top of a page, or occupying (part of) a
float page.
<p>The <i>stfloats</i> package ameliorates the situation somewhat, and
makes LaTeX honour '[b]' placement as well.
<p>The FAQ team doesn't know of any package that will make
LaTeX honour '[h]' placement of double-column floats, but the
<i>midfloat</i> package can be pressed into service to provide
something approximating the effect it would have.
