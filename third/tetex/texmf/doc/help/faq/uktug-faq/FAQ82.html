<h3>Using PostScript fonts with TeX</h3>
<p>In order to use PostScript fonts, TeX needs
<em>metric</em> (called TFM) files. Several sets of metrics are
available from the archives; for mechanisms for generating new ones,
see <a href="FAQ84.html">metrics for PostScript fonts</a>.  You
also need the fonts themselves; PostScript printers come with a set of
fonts built in, but to extend your repertoire you almost invariably
need to buy from one of the many commercial font vendors (see, for
example, <a href="FAQ86.html">"choice of fonts"</a>).
<p>If you use LaTeX2e, the best way to get PostScript fonts into your
document is to use the PSNFSS package maintained by Walter
Schmidt; it's supported by
the LaTeX3 project team, so bug reports can and should be submitted. 
PSNFSS gives you a set of packages for changing the default
roman, sans-serif and typewriter fonts; <em>e.g</em>., <i>times.sty</i> will set
up Times Roman, Helvetica and Courier in place of Computer Modern,
while <i>avant.sty</i> just changes the sans-serif family to
AvantGarde. To go with these packages, you will need the font metric
files (watch out for encoding problems! - see
<a href="FAQ84.html">metrics for PostScript fonts</a>)
and font description (<code>.fd</code>) files for each font family you
want to use. Many sets of metrics, etc., can be obtained from the
<em>psfonts</em> area of CTAN, arranged by
vendor (<em>e.g</em>., Adobe, Monotype, <em>etc</em>.). For convenience,
metrics for the common '35' PostScript fonts found in most printers
are provided with PSNFSS, packaged as the "Laserwriter set".
<p>For older versions of LaTeX there are various schemes, of which the
simplest to use is probably the PSLaTeX macros distributed with
<i>dvips</i>.
<p>For Plain TeX, you load whatever fonts you like; if the encoding of
the fonts is not the same as Computer Modern it will be up to you to
redefine various macros and accents, or you can use the font
re-encoding mechanisms available in many drivers and in
<i>ps2pk</i> and <i>afm2tfm</i>.
<p>Victor Eijkhout's
<a href="FAQ15.html">Lollipop package</a>
supports declaration of font families and styles in a similar way to
LaTeX's NFSS, and so is easy to use with PostScript fonts.
<p>Some common problems encountered are discussed elsewhere
(see <a href="FAQ85.html">problems with PS fonts</a>).
