<H2><A NAME="QU65">Drawing with TeX</A></H2>

<P>
There are many packages to do pictures in (La)TeX itself (rather than
importing graphics created externally), ranging from simple use of
LaTeX <CODE>picture</CODE> environment, through enhancements like <I>epic</I>, to
sophisticated (but slow) drawing with PicTeX. Depending on your type
of drawing, and setup, four systems should be at the top of your list
to look at:
<OL>
<LI> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/graphics/pstricks"><TT>graphics/pstricks</TT></A>; this gives you access to all the power of
  PostScript from TeX itself, by sophisticated use of
  <CODE>\special</CODE>s. You need a decent DVI to PostScript driver
  (like <I>dvips</I>), but the results are worth it.  The
  well-documented package gives you not only low-level drawing
  commands (and full colour) like lines, circles, shapes at arbitrary
  coordinates, but also high-level macros for framing text, drawing
  trees and matrices, 3D effects, and more.
<LI> MetaPost; you liked METAFONT, but never got to grips with font files?
  Try <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU4">MetaPost</A> -
  all the power of METAFONT, but it generates PostScript figures.  Knuth
  uses it for all his work...
<LI> <I>Mfpic</I>; you liked METAFONT, but can't understand the
  language?  The package (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/graphics/mfpic"><TT>graphics/mfpic</TT></A>) makes up METAFONT code for you
  within using familiar-looking TeX macros.  Not <EM>quite</EM> the
  full power of METAFONT, but a friendlier interface.
<LI> You liked PicTeX but don't have enough memory or time?  Look
  at Eitan Gurari's <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/generic/dratex"><TT>macros/generic/dratex</TT></A>, which is as powerful as most
  other TeX drawing packages, but is an entirely new
  implementation, which is not as hard on memory, is much more
  readable (and is fully documented).
</OL>


<H2><A NAME="QU66">Double-spaced documents in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
Are you producing a thesis, and trying to obey regulations that were
drafted in the typewriter era?  Or are you producing copy for a
journal that insists on double spacing for the submitted articles?

<P>
LaTeX is a typesetting system, so the appropriate design
conventions are for ``real books''.  If your requirement is from
thesis regulations, find whoever is responsible for the regulations,
and try to get the wording changed to cater for typeset theses
(<EM>e.g.</EM>, to say ``if using a typesetting system, aim to make your
thesis look like a well-designed book'').  (If your requirement is
from a journal, you're probably even less likely to be able to get the
rules changed, of course.)

<P>
If you fail to convince your officials, or want some inter-line 
space for copy-editing:
<UL>
<LI> Try changing <CODE>\baselinestretch</CODE>:
  <CODE>\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.2}</CODE> may be enough to give
  officials the impression you've kept to their regulations. Don't try
  changing <CODE>\baselineskip</CODE>: its value is reset at any size-changing
  command.
<LI> Alternatively, use a line-spacing package.  The best for current
  is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/setspace/setspace.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/setspace/setspace.sty</TT></A>
</UL>


<H2><A NAME="QU67">Formatting a thesis in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
Thesis styles are usually very specific to your University, so it's
usually not profitable to ask around for a package outside your own
University.  Since many Universities (in their eccentric way) still
require double-spacing, you may care to refer to
the question on <A HREF="texfaq_12.html#QU66">double-spacing</A>.
If you want to write
your own, a good place to start is the University of California style
(available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/ucthesis"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/ucthesis</TT></A>), but
it's not worth going to a lot of trouble. (If officials won't allow
standard typographic conventions, you won't be able to produce an
  aesthetically pleasing document anyway!)


<H2><A NAME="QU68">Flowing text around figures in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
There are several LaTeX packages that purport to do this, but they
all have their limitations because the TeX machine isn't really
designed to solve this sort of problem.  Piet van Oostrum has
conducted a survey of the available packages; he recommends:


<DL>
<DT><CODE>picins</CODE>
<DD><TT>picins.sty</TT> is part of a large package
  (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/msdos/picins/picins.zip"><TT>systems/msdos/picins/picins.zip</TT></A>) that allows inclusion of pictures (e.g., with
  shadow boxes, various MS-DOS formats, etc.).  The command is:

<P>
    <CODE>\parpic(width,height)(x-off,y-off)[Options][Position]{Picture}</CODE><BR>
  <EM>Paragraph text</EM>

<P>
  All parameters except the <EM>Picture</EM> are optional.  The picture
  can be positioned left or right, boxed with a rectangle, oval,
  shadowbox, dashed box, and a caption can be given which will be
  included in the list of figures.

<P>
  Unfortunately (for those of us whose understanding of German is not
  good), the documentation is in German.  Piet van Oostrum has written
  an English summary <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex209/contrib/picins/picins.txt"><TT>macros/latex209/contrib/picins/picins.txt</TT></A>
<DT><CODE>floatflt</CODE>
<DD><A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/floatflt"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/floatflt</TT></A> is an improved version
  (for LaTeX2e) of <TT>floatfig.sty</TT>, and its syntax is:


<PRE>
\begin{floatingfigure}[options]{width of figure}
   figure contents
\end{floatingfigure}
</PRE>

<P>
  There is a (more or less similar) <CODE>floatingtable</CODE> environment.

<P>
  The tables or figures can be set left or right, or alternating on
  even/odd pages in a double-sided document.

<P>
  The package works with the <CODE>multicol</CODE> package, but doesn't work well
  in the neighbourhood of list environments (unless you change your
  LaTeX document).
<DT><CODE>wrapfig</CODE>
<DD><A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/wrapfig.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/wrapfig.sty</TT></A> has syntax:


<PRE>
\begin{wrapfigure}[height of figure in lines]{l|r}[overhang]{width}
  figure, caption, etc.
\end{wrapfigure}
</PRE>

<P>
  The syntax of the <CODE>wraptable</CODE> environment is similar.

<P>
  Height can be omitted, in which case it will be calculated by the
  package; the package will use the greater of the specified and the
  actual width.  The <CODE>{l</CODE><EM>,</EM><CODE>r</CODE><EM>,etc</EM>.<CODE>}</CODE> parameter can also be
  specified as <CODE>i</CODE><EM>(nside)</EM> or <CODE>o</CODE><EM>(utside)</EM> for two-sided
  documents, and uppercase can be used to indicate that the picture
  should float.  The overhang allows the figure to be moved into the
  margin.  The figure or table will entered into the list of figures
  or tables if you use the <CODE>\caption</CODE> command.

<P>
  The environments do not work within list environments that end
  before the figure or table has finished, but can be used in a parbox
  or minipage, and in twocolumn format.
</DL>


<H2><A NAME="QU69">Alternative head- and footlines in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
The standard LaTeX document classes define a small set of `page
styles' which (in effect) specify head- and footlines for your
document.  The set defined is very restricted, but LaTeX is capable
of much more; people occasionally set about employing LaTeX
facilities to do the job, but that's quite unnecessary - Piet van
Oostrum has already done the work.

<P>
The package is found in directory <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyhdr"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyhdr</TT></A> and provides
simple mechanisms for defining pretty much every head- or footline
variation you could want; the directory also contains some (rather
good) documentation and one or two smaller packages.  Fancyhdr
also deals with the tedious behaviour of the standard styles with
  <A HREF="texfaq_14.html#QU98">initial pages</A>,
by enabling you to define
different page styles for initial and for body pages.


<H2><A NAME="QU70">Including a file in verbatim in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
A good way is to use Rainer Sch&ouml;pf's <TT>verbatim.sty</TT>,
which provides a command <CODE>\verbatiminput</CODE> that takes a file name
as argument. This package is available as part of <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools"><TT>macros/latex/required/tools</TT></A>

<P>
Another way is to use the <CODE>alltt</CODE> environment, which requires
<TT>alltt.sty</TT> (which is now part of LaTeX).  <CODE>alltt</CODE> interprets
its contents `mostly' verbatim, but executes any TeX commands it
finds: so one can say:
<PRE>
  \begin{alltt}
  \input{verb.txt}
  \end{alltt}
</PRE>
<P>
of course, this is little use for inputting (La)TeX source code...

<P>
The <TT>moreverb</TT> package (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/moreverb"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/moreverb</TT></A>) extends the
facilities of <TT>verbatim</TT> package), providing a <CODE>listing</CODE>
environment and a <CODE>\listinginput</CODE> command, which line-number the text
of the file.

<P>
The <TT>fancyvrb</TT> package (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyvrb"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyvrb</TT></A>) offers configurable
implementations of everything <TT>verbatim</TT> and <TT>moreverb</TT>
have, and more besides.  It is nowadays the package of choice for the
discerning typesetter of verbatim text, but its wealth of facilities
makes it a complex beast and study of the documentation is strongly
advised.


<H2><A NAME="QU71">Including line numbers in typeset output</A></H2>

<P>
For general numbering of lines, there are two packages for use with
LaTeX, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/lineno"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/lineno</TT></A> (which permits labels attached to
individual lines of typeset output) and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/numline/numline.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/numline/numline.sty</TT></A>

<P>
Both of these packages play fast and loose with the LaTeX output
routine, which can cause problems: the user should beware\dots

<P>
If the requirement is for numbering verbatim text, the
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/moreverb"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/moreverb</TT></A> or <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyvrb"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/fancyvrb</TT></A> packages (see
<A HREF="texfaq_12.html#QU70">including files in verbatim</A>) may be used.

<P>
One common use of line numbers is in critical editions of texts, and
for this the <I>edmac</I> package (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/plain/contrib/edmac"><TT>macros/plain/contrib/edmac</TT></A>) offers comprehensive
support.


<H2><A NAME="QU72">Generating an index in (La)TeX</A></H2>

<P>
Making an index is not trivial; what to index, and how to index it, is
difficult to decide, and uniform implementation is difficult to
achieve.  You will need to mark all items to be indexed in your text
(typically with <CODE>\index</CODE> commands).

<P>
It is not practical to sort
a large index within TeX, so a post-processing program is used to sort
the output of one TeX run, to be included into the document at the
next run.

<P>
The following programs are available:
<DL>
<DT>makeindex
<DD>for LaTeX under Unix (but runs under other OSs
  without changes).  Available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/indexing/makeindex"><TT>indexing/makeindex</TT></A>; a version for
  the Macintosh is available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/mac/macmakeindex.sit"><TT>systems/mac/macmakeindex.sit</TT></A>, and ones for
  MS-DOS are part of the emTeX and gTeX distributions (the
  emTeX version also runs under OS/2).

<P>
  The Makeindex documentation is a good source of information on how
  to create your own index. Makeindex can be used with some TeX
  macro packages other than LaTeX, such as 
  <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU11">Eplain</A>, and \TeXsis{}, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/nonfree/macros/texsis"><TT>nonfree/macros/texsis</TT></A>
  (whose macros, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/nonfree/macros/texsis/index/index.tex"><TT>nonfree/macros/texsis/index/index.tex</TT></A>, can be used independently
  with plain).
<DT>idxtex
<DD>for LaTeX under VMS.  Available (together with a
  glossary-maker called <CODE>glotex</CODE>) in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/indexing/glo+idxtex"><TT>indexing/glo+idxtex</TT></A>
<DT>texindex
<DD>A witty little shell/<I>sed</I>-script-based
  utility for LaTeX under Unix.  Available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/texindex"><TT>support/texindex</TT></A>

<P>
  There are other programs called <I>texindex</I>, notably
  one that comes with the
  <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU13">Texinfo</A> distribution.
<DT>xindy
<DD>a recent development, designed for wide-ranging
  flexibility (including support for multilingual indexes), based on
  Common Lisp.  The system is available on CTAN
  (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/xindy"><TT>support/xindy</TT></A>), but is more easily accessed from a web
  browser via <A HREF="http://www.iti.informatik.th-darmstadt.de/xindy/"><TT>http://www.iti.informatik.th-darmstadt.de/xindy/</TT></A>
  since the distribution contains several different implementations.
</DL>


<H2><A NAME="QU73">Typesetting URLs</A></H2>

<P>
URLs tend to be very long, and contain characters that would
naturally prevent them being hyphenated even if they weren't typically
set in <CODE>\ttfamily</CODE>, verbatim.  Therefore, without special treatment,
they often produce wildly overfull <CODE>\hbox</CODE>es, and their typeset
representation is awful.

<P>
There are two approaches to this problem:
<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/path.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/path.sty</TT></A>, which defines a <CODE>\path</CODE> command.  The command
  defines each potential break character as a <CODE>\discretionary</CODE>, and
  offers the user the opportunity of specifying a personal list of
  potential break characters.  Its chief disadvantage is fragility in
  the LaTeX context.
<LI> <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/url.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/url.sty</TT></A>, which defines an <CODE>\url</CODE> command (among others,
  including its own <CODE>\path</CODE> command).  The command gives each
  potential break character a maths-mode `personality', and then sets
  the URL itself in the user's choice of font, in maths mode.
  It can produce (LaTeX-style) `robust' commands
  (\htmlonly{see }<A HREF="texfaq_15.html#QU110">use of <CODE>\protect</CODE></A>) for use
  within moving arguments.  Note that, because the operation is
  conducted in maths mode, spaces within the URL argument are
  ignored unless special steps are taken.
</UL>

<P>
The author of this answer prefers the (rather newer) <TT>url.sty</TT>;
both packages work equally well with plain TeX (though of course,
the fancy LaTeX facilities of <TT>url.sty</TT> don't have much place
there).


<H2><A NAME="QU74">Citing URLs with BibTeX</A></H2>

<P>
There is no citation type for URLs, <EM>per se</EM>, in the
standard BibTeX styles, though Oren Patashnik (the author of
BibTeX) is considering developing one such for use with the
long-awaited BibTeX version 1.0.

<P>
The actual information that need be available in a citation of an
URL is discussed at some length in the publicly available
on-line extracts of ISO 690-2, available via
<A HREF="http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/standard/690-2e.htm"><TT>http://www.nlc-bnc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/standard/690-2e.htm</TT></A>; the
techniques below do <EM>not</EM> satisfy all the requirements of
ISO 690-2, but they offer a solution that is at least
available to users of today's tools.

<P>
Until the new version arrives, the simplest technique is to use the
<CODE>howpublished</CODE> field of the standard styles' <CODE>@misc</CODE> function.  Of
course, the strictures
\htmlonly{about }<A HREF="texfaq_12.html#QU73">typesetting URLs</A>
 still apply, so the entry will look like:
<PRE>
  @misc{...,
    ...,
    howpublished = &quot;\url{http://...}&quot;
  }
</PRE>

<P>
Another possibility is that some conventionally-published paper,
technical report (or even book) is also available on the Web.  In such
cases, a useful technique is something like:
<PRE>
  @techreport{...,
    ...,
    note = &quot;Also available as \url{http://...}&quot;
  }
</PRE>

<P>
There is good reason to use <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/url.sty"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/other/misc/url.sty</TT></A> in this context, since (by
default) it ignores spaces in its argument.  BibTeX has a habit of
splitting lines it considers excessively long, and if there are no
space characters for it to use as `natural' breakpoints, BibTeX
will insert a comment (`<CODE>\textpercent</CODE>')
character ...  which is an acceptable character in an URL,
so that <CODE>\url</CODE> will typeset it.  The way around the problem is to
insert odd spaces inside the URL itself in the <CODE>.bib</CODE> file, to
enable BibTeX to make reasonable decisions about breaking the
line.


<H2><A NAME="QU75">Using BibTeX with <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX</A></H2>

<P>
The file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/eplain/btxmac.tex"><TT>macros/eplain/btxmac.tex</TT></A> contains macros and documentation
for using BibTeX with <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX, either directly or with
<A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU11">Eplain</A>.
See <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU22">the use of BibTeX</A> for more
information about BibTeX itself.


<H2><A NAME="QU76">Typesetting music in TeX</A></H2>

<P>
A powerful package which allows the typesetting of
polyphonic and other multiple-stave music is MusicTeX, written by
Daniel Taupin 
(<SAMP>taupin@rsovax.lps.u-psud.fr</SAMP>). It is available 
in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/musictex"><TT>macros/musictex</TT></A>

<P>
In the recent past, Daniel (as well as with various other people,
notably Ross Mitchell and Andreas Egler) have been working on a development of
MusicTeX, known as MusiXTeX.  MusiXTeX is a three-pass
system (with a processor program that computes values for the element
spacing in the music), and achieves finer control than is possible in
the unmodified TeX-based mechanism that MusicTeX uses.  Daniel
Taupin and Andreas Egler are pursuing distinct versions of
MusiXTeX; they are available, respectively, from
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/musixtex/taupin"><TT>macros/musixtex/taupin</TT></A> and <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/musixtex/egler"><TT>macros/musixtex/egler</TT></A>

<P>
Digital music fans can typeset notation for their efforts by using
<I>midi2tex</I>, which translates MIDI data files into MusicTeX
source code.  It is available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/midi2tex"><TT>support/midi2tex</TT></A>

<P>
A rather simpler notation than MusicTeX is supported by <I>abc2mtex</I>;
this is a package designed to notate tunes stored in an ASCII format
(<CODE>abc</CODE> notation). It was designed primarily for folk and traditional
tunes of Western European origin (such as Irish, English and Scottish)
which can be written on one stave in standard classical notation.
However, it should be extendable to many other types of music.  It is
available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/abc2mtex"><TT>support/abc2mtex</TT></A>

<P>
There is a mailing list for discussion of typesetting music in TeX.
To subscribe, send mail to <SAMP>mutex-request@stolaf.edu</SAMP> containing
the word `<CODE>subscribe</CODE>' in the body.


<H2><A NAME="QU77">Drawing Feynman diagrams in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
Michael Levine's macro package for drawing Feynman diagrams in LaTeX
is available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex209/contrib/feynman"><TT>macros/latex209/contrib/feynman</TT></A>

<P>
Another possibility is Thorsten Ohl's <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/feynmf"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/feynmf</TT></A>, that works in
combination with METAFONT (or MetaPost).  The <I>feynmf</I> or
<I>feynmp</I> package reads a description of the diagram written
in TeX, and writes out code.  METAFONT (or MetaPost) can then produce a
font (or PostScript file) for use in a subsequent LaTeX run.  For
new users, who have access to MetaPost, the PostScript version is
probably the better route, for document portability and other reasons.
