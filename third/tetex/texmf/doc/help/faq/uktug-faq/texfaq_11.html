<H1><A NAME="SEC11">PostScript and TeX</A></H1>


<H2><A NAME="QU59">Using PostScript fonts with TeX</A></H2>

<P>
In order to use PostScript fonts, TeX needs
<EM>metric</EM> (called TFM) files. Several sets of metrics are
available from the archives; for mechanisms for generating new ones,
see <A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU61">metrics for PostScript fonts</A>.  You
also need the fonts themselves; PostScript printers come with a set of
fonts built in, but to extend your repertoire you almost invariably
need to buy from one of the many commercial font vendors (see, for
example, <A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU63">choice of fonts</A>).

<P>
If you use LaTeX2e, the best way to get PostScript fonts into your
document is to use the PSNFSS package maintained by Sebastian Rahtz
and Alan Jeffrey (available in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/psnfss"><TT>macros/latex/required/psnfss</TT></A>); it's supported by
the LaTeX3 project team, so bug reports can and should be submitted. 
PSNFSS gives you a set of packages for changing the default
roman, sans-serif and typewriter fonts; <EM>e.g</EM>., <TT>times.sty</TT> will set
up Times Roman, Helvetica and Courier in place of Computer Modern,
while <TT>avant.sty</TT> just changes the sans-serif family to
AvantGarde. To go with these packages, you will need the font metric
files (watch out for encoding problems! see
<A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU61">metrics for PostScript fonts</A>)
and font description (<CODE>.fd</CODE>) files for each font family you
want to use. These can be obtained from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts"><TT>fonts/psfonts</TT></A>, arranged by
vendor (<EM>e.g</EM>., Adobe, Monotype, <EM>etc</EM>.). For convenience,
metrics for the common `35' PostScript fonts found in most printers
are provided with PSNFSS, packaged as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/packages/psnfss/lw35nfss.zip"><TT>macros/latex/packages/psnfss/lw35nfss.zip</TT></A>

<P>
For older versions of LaTeX there are various schemes, of which the
simplest to use is probably the PSLaTeX macros distributed with
<I>dvips</I>.

<P>
For <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX, you load whatever fonts you like; if the encoding of
the fonts is not the same as Computer Modern it will be up to you to
redefine various macros and accents, or you can use the font
re-encoding mechanisms available in many drivers and in
<I>ps2pk</I> and <I>afm2tfm</I>.

<P>
Victor Eijkhout's sophisticated Lollipop package (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/lollipop"><TT>macros/lollipop</TT></A>)
supports declaration of font families and styles in a similar way to
LaTeX's NFSS, and so is easy to use with PostScript fonts.

<P>
Some common problems encountered are discussed elsewhere
(see <A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU62">problems with PS fonts</A>).


<H2><A NAME="QU60">Previewing files using PostScript fonts</A></H2>

<P>
Most TeX previewers only display bitmap PK fonts. If you want to
preview documents using PostScript fonts, you have three choices:
<OL>
<LI> Convert the DVI file to PostScript and use a
  PostScript previewer. Some modern Unix X implementations have this
  built in (as does NeXT-step); (X11) Unix, Windows, OS/2, and MS-DOS
  users can use the free <I>GhostScript</I> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/support/ghostscript"><TT>support/ghostscript</TT></A>), a
  complete level 2 implementation.
<LI> Under Windows on a PC, or on a Macintosh, let Adobe Type Manager
  display the fonts. Textures (Macintosh) works like this, and under
  Windows you can use Y&Y's <I>dviwindo</I> for bitmap-free
  previewing.
    (See <A HREF="texfaq_5.html#QU40">commercial suppliers</A> for details.)
<LI> If you have the PostScript fonts in Type 1 format,
  use <I>ps2pk</I> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/ps2pk"><TT>fonts/utilities/ps2pk</TT></A>) or <I>gsftopk</I>
  (designed for use with the <I>GhostScript</I> fonts;
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/gsftopk"><TT>fonts/utilities/gsftopk</TT></A>) to make PK bitmap fonts which your previewer
  will understand. This can produce excellent results, also suitable
  for printing with non-PostScript devices. Check the legalities of
  this if you have purchased the fonts. The very commonest PostScript
  fonts such as Times and Courier come in Type 1 format on disk with
  Adobe Type Manager (often bundled with Windows, and part of OS/2).
</OL>


<H2><A NAME="QU61">TeX font metric files for PostScript fonts</A></H2>

<P>
Font vendors such as Adobe supply metric files for each font, in AFM
(Adobe Font Metric) form; these can be converted to TFM
(TeX Font Metric) form. The CTAN archives have prebuilt metrics
which will be more than enough for many people (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/psfonts"><TT>fonts/psfonts</TT></A>;
beware - this directory is at the root of a huge tree), but you may
need to do the conversion yourself if you have special needs or
acquire a new font. One important question is the <EM>encoding</EM> of
(Latin character) fonts; while we all more or less agree about the
position of about 96 characters in fonts (the basic ASCII set), the
rest of the (typically) 256 vary. The most obvious problems are with
floating accents and special characters such as the `pounds sterling'
sign. There are three ways of dealing with this: either you change the
TeX macros which reference the characters (not much fun, and
error-prone); or you change the encoding of the font (easier than you
might think); or you use
<A HREF="texfaq_3.html#QU30">virtual fonts</A>
to <EM>pretend</EM> to
TeX that the encoding is the same as it is used to. If you use
LaTeX2e, it allows for changing the encoding in TeX; read the
<EM>LaTeX Companion</EM>
(see <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">TeX-related books</A>) for more details. 
In practice, if you do much non-English (but Latin script)
typesetting, you are strongly recommended to use the <CODE>fontenc</CODE>
package with option `<CODE>T1</CODE>' to select T1
  (<A HREF="texfaq_3.html#QU33">`Cork'</A>)
encoding. 

<P>
Alan Jeffrey's <I>fontinst</I> package (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/fontinst"><TT>fonts/utilities/fontinst</TT></A>) is an
AFM to TFM converter written in TeX; it is used to
generate the
files used by LaTeX2e's PSNFSS package 
to support use of PostScript fonts. It is a sophisticated package, not
for the faint-hearted, but is powerful enough to cope with most needs.
Much of its power relies on the use of
<A HREF="texfaq_3.html#QU30">virtual fonts</A>.

<P>
For slightly simpler problems, Rokicki's <I>afm2tfm</I>,
distributed with <I>dvips</I> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/dviware/dvips"><TT>dviware/dvips</TT></A>), is fast and
efficient; note that the metrics and styles that come with
<I>dvips</I> are <EM>not</EM> currently LaTeX2e compatible, but
Karl Berry plans to distribute metrics directly compatible with PSNFSS
in his <I>dvipsk</I> package.

<P>
For the Macintosh, there is a program called <I>EdMetrics</I> which does
the job (and more).  It comes with the Textures distribution, but is
in fact free software, available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/mac/textures/utilities/EdMetrics.sea.hqx"><TT>systems/mac/textures/utilities/EdMetrics.sea.hqx</TT></A>

<P>
MS-DOS users can buy
(see <A HREF="texfaq_5.html#QU40">commercial implementations</A>)
Y&Y's Font Manipulation Tools package which includes a powerful
<I>afmtotfm</I> program among many other goodies.


<H2><A NAME="QU62">Problems using PostScript fonts</A></H2>

<P>
For the typical LaTeX user trying to use the
<A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU59">PSNFSS</A>
package, three questions often arise.
First, you have to declare to the DVI driver that you are using
PostScript fonts; in the case of <I>dvips</I>, this means adding
lines to the <CODE>psfonts.map</CODE> file. Otherwise, <I>dvips</I> will try
to find PK 
files. If the font isn't built into the printer, you have to acquire
it (in many cases this means buying it from a commercial supplier!).
You then have to instruct the driver to download it with each job (the
mechanism depends on your driver). So it's no
good just installing the <EM>metrics</EM> for Optima and expecting it to
work. You have to pay hard cash for the font itself, which will come
(for Unix and MS-DOS users) in <CODE>pfb</CODE> (Printer Font Binary) form.

<P>
Second, you cannot expect your previewer to suddenly start displaying
PostScript fonts; most of them only know about PK bitmap fonts
such as Computer Modern. <I>ps2pk</I> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/fonts/utilities/ps2pk"><TT>fonts/utilities/ps2pk</TT></A>) can create
these from the <CODE>pfb</CODE> file you have bought; this would also let you use
the fonts with non-PostScript device drivers such as the emTeX
ones.  You are responsible for making sure you are not breaking the
licence restrictions on font you bought.

<P>
Third, the stretch and shrink between words is a function of the
font metric; it is not specified in AFM files, so different converters
choose different values. The PostScript metrics that come with PSNFSS 
used to produce quite tight setting, but they were revised in mid 1995
to produce a compromise between American and European practice. Really
sophisticated users may not find even the new the values to their taste, and
want to override them. Even the casual user may find  more
hyphenation or overfull boxes than CMR produces; but CMR
is extremely generous. 


<H2><A NAME="QU63">Choice of scalable outline fonts</A></H2>

<P>
If you are interested in text alone, you can use any of over 20,000
fonts(!) in Adobe Type 1 format (called `PostScript fonts' in the
TeX world and `ATM fonts' in the DTP world), or any of several
hundred fonts in TrueType format.  That is, provided of course, that
your previewer and printer driver support scalable outline fonts.

<P>
TeX itself <EM>only</EM> cares about metrics, not the actual
character programs.  You just need to create a TeX metric file
TFM using some tool such as <I>afm2tfm</I>, <I>afmtotfm</I>
(from Y&Y, see <A HREF="texfaq_5.html#QU40">commercial implementations</A>)
or <I>fontinst</I>.  For the previewer or printer driver you need the
actual outline font files themselves (<CODE>pfa</CODE> for Display PostScript, <CODE>pfb</CODE>
for ATM on IBM PC, Mac outline font files on Macintosh).

<P>
If you also need mathematics, then you are severely limited by the
demands that TeX makes of maths fonts (for details, see the paper by B.K.P. 
Horn in <CITE>TUGboat</CITE> 14(3)).
For maths, then, there are relatively few choices:
<DL>
<DT><EM>Computer Modern</EM>
<DD>(75 fonts - optical scaling) Donald E. Knuth<BR>
    Note that CM <EM>is</EM> available in scalable outline form.
    There are commercial as well as public domain versions, and
    there are both Adobe Type 1 and TrueType versions.
    Some of these are `commercial grade,' with full hand-tuned hinting,
    some render very poorly, while others are merely incompatible with 
    Adobe Type Manager (ATM).
<DT><EM>Lucida Bright <EM>with</EM> Lucida New Math</EM>
<DD>(25 fonts) Chuck Bigelow and
  Kris Holmes<BR>
    Lucida is a family of related fonts including seriffed, sans serif,
    sans serif fixed width, calligraphic, blackletter, fax,
    Kris Holmes' connected handwriting font, <EM>etc</EM>; they're
    not as `spindly' as Computer Modern, with a large x-height, and
    include a larger set of maths symbols, operators, relations and
    delimiters than CM (over 800 instead of 384: among others, it also
    includes the AMS <CODE>msam</CODE> and <CODE>msbm</CODE> symbol sets).
    The planned `Lucida Bright Expert' (14 fonts)
    adds seriffed fixed width, another handwriting font,
    smallcaps, bold maths, upright `maths italic', <EM>etc</EM>., to the set
    The distribution includes support for use with <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX and
    LaTeX 2.09.  Support under LaTeX2e is provided in
    <A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU59">PSNFSS</A>
    thanks to Sebastian Rahtz.
<DT><EM>MathTime 1.1</EM>
<DD>(3 fonts) TeXplorators (Michael Spivak)<BR>
    The set contains maths italic, symbol, and extension
    fonts, designed to work well with Times-Roman.  These are
    typically used with Times, Helvetica and Courier (which are
    resident on many printers, and which are supplied with
    some PC versions).  In addition you may want to complement this
    basic set with Adobe's Times Smallcap, and perhaps the set of
    Adobe `Math Pi' fonts, which include blackboard bold, blackletter,
    and script faces.  The distribution includes support for use with
    <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX and LaTeX 2.09 (including code to link in Adobe Math
    Pi 2 and Math Pi 6).
    Support under LaTeX2e is provided in
    <A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU59">PSNFSS</A>
    thanks to Sebastian Rahtz.
<DT><EM>Adobe Lucida, LucidaSans <EM>and</EM> LucidaMath</EM>
<DD>(12 fonts)<BR>
    Lucida and LucidaMath are generally considered to be a bit heavy.
    The three maths fonts contain only the glyphs in the CM
    maths italic, symbol, and extension fonts.
    Support for using LucidaMath with TeX is not very good;
    you will need to do some work reencoding fonts <EM>etc</EM>.
    (In some sense this set is the ancestor of the LucidaBright
    plus LucidaNewMath font set.)
<DT><EM>Concrete, <EM>the</EM> AMS maths fonts <EM>etc</EM>.</EM>
<DD>Donald
  E. Knuth and the AMS.<BR>
    These are sometimes mentioned as alternatives to CM, but they are
    really adjuncts, in that you need to use at least the basic CM
    maths fonts with them.
<DT><EM>Proprietary fonts</EM>
<DD>Various sources.<BR>
    Since having a high quality font set in scalable outline form that
    works with TeX can give a publisher a real competitive advantage, there
    are some publishers that have paid (a lot) to have such font sets made
    for them.  Unfortunately, these sets are not available on the open
    market, despite the likelihood that they're more complete than
    those that are.
<DT><EM>Mathptm</EM>
<DD>(4 fonts) Alan Jeffrey.<BR>
   This set contains maths italic, symbol, extension, and roman 
   virtual fonts, built from Adobe Times, Symbol, Zapf Chancery, and
   the Computer Modern fonts.  The Mathptm fonts are free, and
   the resulting PostScript files can be freely exchanged.
   Contains most of the CM math symbols. 
   Support under LaTeX2e in
    <A HREF="texfaq_11.html#QU59">PSNFSS</A>
    thanks to Alan Jeffrey and Sebastian Rahtz.  

<P>
    (A similar development by Thomas Esser, using the Adobe Palatino
    fonts, is available from <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX/updates/texmf/mathppl.sh"><TT>systems/unix/teTeX/updates/texmf/mathppl.sh</TT></A>)
</DL>

<P>
All of the first three font sets are available in formats suitable for
IBM PC/Windows, Macintosh and Unix/NeXT from Y&Y and from Blue Sky
Research (see <A HREF="texfaq_5.html#QU40">commercial suppliers</A> for
details).  The MathTime fonts are also available from:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  TeXplorators<BR>
  1572 West Gray #377<BR>
  Houston TX 77019<BR>
  USA
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The very limited selection of maths font sets is a direct result of
the fact that a maths font has to be explicitly designed for use with
TeX and as a result it is likely to lose some of its appeal in
other markets. Furthermore, the TeX market for commercial fonts is
minute (in comparison, for example, to Microsoft TrueType font pack
#1, which sold something like 10 million copies in a few weeks after
release of Windows 3.1!).

<P>
Text fonts in Type 1 format are available from many vendors including
Adobe, Monotype, Bitstream.  Avoid cheap rip-offs: not only are you
rewarding unethical behaviour, destroying the cottage industry of
innovative type design, but you are <EM>also</EM> very likely to get junk.
The fonts may not render well (or at all under ATM), may not have the
`standard' complement of 228 glyphs, or may not include metric files
(needed to make TFM files). Also, avoid TrueType fonts from all but
the major vendors.  TrueType fonts are an order of magnitude harder to
`hint' properly than Type 1 fonts and hence TrueType fonts from places
other than Microsoft and Apple may be suspect.  In any case you may
find other problems with TrueType fonts such as service bureaux not
accepting jobs calling for them.


<H2><A NAME="QU64">Including a PostScript figure in LaTeX</A></H2>

<P>
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU116">LaTeX2e</A>
has a standard package
for graphics inclusion, rotation, colour, and other driver-related
features. The package is documented in the second edition of the
Lamport's LaTeX book
(see <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">TeX-related books</A>), and is available
in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics"><TT>macros/latex/required/graphics</TT></A>

<P>
If you don't use LaTeX2e, perhaps the best method is to use
the <CODE>psfig</CODE> macros written by Trevor Darrell, available in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/graphics/psfig"><TT>graphics/psfig</TT></A>

<P>
You will also need a DVI to PostScript conversion program that
supports the <CODE>\special</CODE>s. The drivers mentioned in
<A HREF="texfaq_6.html#QU41">DVI to PostScript programs</A> do, and come
with a version of <CODE>psfig</CODE> ready to use with them. The <CODE>psfig</CODE> macros
work best with Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPS). In particular,
<CODE>psfig</CODE> will need the file to have a BoundingBox (see Appendix H of
the
<EM>PostScript Language Reference Manual</EM>). If you don't have an EPS
file, life can be difficult.

<P>
One point to note about including PostScript figures is that they
are not part of the DVI file, but are only included when you
use a DVI
to PostScript conversion program. As a result, most DVI previewers
will simply show the blank space TeX has reserved for your figure,
not the figure itself. 

<P>
There are two rather good documents on CTAN addressing of figure
production with rather different emphasis.  Anil K. Goel's,
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/figsinltx.ps"><TT>info/figsinltx.ps</TT></A> covers the different ways in which you might
generate figures, and one the old (LaTeX 2.09) ways of including them
into documents.  Keith Reckdahl's, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/info/epslatex.ps"><TT>info/epslatex.ps</TT></A>, covers the
standard LaTeX2e facilities, as well as some of the supporting
packages, notably <I>subfigure</I> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/subfigure"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/subfigure</TT></A>) and
<I>psfrag</I> (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/psfrag"><TT>macros/latex/contrib/supported/psfrag</TT></A>).
