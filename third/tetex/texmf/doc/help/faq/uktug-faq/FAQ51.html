<h3>Finding files by Web search</h3>
<p>Two of the CTAN web servers offer a search facility:
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/search">http://www.tex.ac.uk/search</a> and
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/search">http://www.ctan.org/search</a>; you can look for a file whose name
you already know
  (in pretty much the same way as the
  <a href="FAQ50.html"><code>ftp</code>-based <code>quote site index</code> command</a>),

or you can do a keyword-based search of the
catalogue.
<p>The search script produces URLs for files that match your
search criteria.  The URLs point to the CTAN site or
mirror of your choice; when you first use the script, it asks you to
choose a site, and stores its details
in a cookie on your machine.  Choose a site that is close
to you, to reduce network load.
<p>The Catalogue, which the search script uses, may be browsed
independently: it's actually kept within the archive itself: to browse
it, visit <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/">http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/</a>,
<a href="http://www.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/">http://www.dante.de/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/</a> or
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/">http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/</a>

  tree: browsing, rather than downloading the whole tree, is encouraged)
