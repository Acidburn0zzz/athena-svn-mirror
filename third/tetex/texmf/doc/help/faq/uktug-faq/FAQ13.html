<h3>What are the AMS packages (AMSTeX, <em>etc</em>.)?</h3>

<p>AMSTeX is a TeX macro package, originally written by Michael Spivak for
the American Mathematical Society (AMS) during 1983-1985 and
is described in the book 
"<a href="FAQ22.html">The Joy of TeX</a>".
It is based on Plain TeX, and provides many
features for producing more professional-looking maths formulas with
less burden on authors.  It pays attention to the finer details of
sizing and positioning that mathematical publishers care about. The
aspects covered include multi-line displayed equations, equation
numbering, ellipsis dots, matrices, double accents, multi-line
subscripts, syntax checking (faster processing on initial
error-checking TeX runs), and other things.
<p>As LaTeX increased in popularity, authors asked to submit papers to
the AMS in LaTeX, and so the AMS developed
AMSLaTeX, which is a
collection of LaTeX packages and classes that offer authors most of
the functionality of AMSTeX.
