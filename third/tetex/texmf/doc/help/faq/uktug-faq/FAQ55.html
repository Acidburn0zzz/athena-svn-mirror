<h3>TeX-friendly editors and shells</h3>
<p>There are good TeX-writing environments and editors for most
operating systems; some are described below, but this is only a
personal selection:
<dl>
<dt>Unix<dd> Try
  <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">GNU~<i>emacs</i></a>
  or <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/"><i>xemacs</i></a>, and
  the AUC-TeX
  bundle (available from CTAN).  AUC-TeX provides menu
  items and control sequences for common constructs, checks syntax,
  lays out markup nicely, lets you call TeX and drivers from
  within the editor, and everything else like this that you can think
  of.  Complex, but very powerful.
<p>  Many who fail to find the versions of <i>emacs</i> attractive, prefer
  <a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net"><i>vim</i></a>, a highly configurable
  editor (also available for Windows and Macintosh systems).  Many
  plugins are available to support the needs of the (La)TeX user,
  including syntax highlighting, calling TeX programs,
  auto-insertion and -completion of common (La)TeX structures, and
  browsing LaTeX help.  The scripts <i>auctex.vim</i> and
  <i>bibtex.vim</i> seem to be the most common recommendations.
<p>  <a href="http://nedit.org/"><i>Nedit</i></a> is another free,
  programmable, editor available for Unix systems.  An
  AUC-TeX-alike package for <i>Nedit</i> is available
  from CTAN.
<dt>MSDOS<dd> TeXshell is a simple,
  easily-customisable environment, which can be used with the editor
  of your choice.
<p>  Eddi4TeX (shareware) is a specially-written TeX
  editor which features intelligent colouring, bracket matching,
  syntax checking, online help and the ability to call TeX
  programs from within the editor. It is highly customisable, and
  features a powerful macro language.
<p>  You can also use GNU <i>emacs</i> and AUC-TeX
  under MSDOS.
<dt>Windows '9x, NT, etc.<dd> <i>Winedt</i>, a shareware package,
  is highly spoken of.  It provides a shell for the use of TeX and
  related programs, as well as a powerful and well-configured editor.
<p>  The 4AllTeX CDROM
  
  (see <a href="FAQ53.html">TeX CDROMs</a>) contains another
  powerful Windows-based shell.
<p>  Both <i>emacs</i> and <i>vim</i> are available in versions
  for Windows systems.
<dt>OS/2<dd> Eddi4TeX works under OS/2; an alternative
  is
  <i>epmtex</i>, which offers an OS/2-specific shell.
<dt>Macintosh<dd> The commercial Textures provides an excellent integrated
  Macintosh environment with its own editor.  More powerful still (as an
  editor) is the shareware <i>Alpha</i> which is
  extensible enough to let you perform almost any TeX-related job. It
  works well with OzTeX.
<p>  <i>Vim</i> is available for use on Macintosh systems.
</dl>
Atari, Amiga and NeXT users also have nice
environments. LaTeX users looking for <i>make</i>-like
facilities should try <i>latexmk</i>.
<p>There is another set of shell programs to help you manipulate
BibTeX databases.
