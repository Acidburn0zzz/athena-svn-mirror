<h3>What is MetaPost?</h3>
<p>The MetaPost system (by John Hobby) implements a picture-drawing language
very much like that of Metafont except that it outputs Encapsulated PostScript
files instead of run-length-encoded bitmaps.  MetaPost is a powerful
language for producing figures for documents to be printed on PostScript
printers, either directly or embedded in (La)TeX documents. It
includes facilities for directly integrating TeX text and
mathematics with the graphics. (Knuth tells us that he uses nothing
but MetaPost for diagrams in text that he is writing.)
<p>The PostScript output is
of such a simple form that MetaPost output files can be directly
included in <a href="FAQ279.html">PDFLaTeX</a>

documents. 
<p>Much of MetaPost's source code was copied from Metafont's sources with
Knuth's permission.
