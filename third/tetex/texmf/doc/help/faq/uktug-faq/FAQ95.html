<h3>Labelling graphics</h3>
<p>"Technical" graphics (such as graphs and diagrams) are often
labelled with quite complex mathematical expressions: there are few
(if any) drawing or graphing tools that can do such things.
<p>This is where the <i>psfrag</i> package can help.  Place an unique
text in your graphic, using the normal text features of your tool, and
you can ask <i>psfrag</i> to replace the text with arbitrary
(La)TeX material.  <i>Psfrag</i>'s "operative" command is
<code>\psfrag{<em>PS text</em>}{<em>Repl text</em>}</code>, which instructs
the system to replace the original ("<code>PS</code>") text with
TeX-typeset replacement text.  Optional
arguments permit adjustment of position, scale and rotation; full
details may be found in <i>pfgguide</i> in the distribution.
(Unfortunately, <i>psfrag</i> can't be used with PDFLaTeX,
though one might hope that it would be susceptible to the same sort of
treatment as is used in the <i>pdftricks</i> package.)
<p>Another pleasing package is <i>overpic</i>, which overlays a
<code>picture</code> environment on a graphic included by use of
<code>\includegraphics</code>.  This treatment lends itself to ready placement
of texts and the like on top of a graphic.  The package can draw a
grid for planning your "attack"; the distribution comes with simple
examples.
<p>And the confident user may, of course, do the whole job in a picture
environment which itself includes the graphic.  I would recommend
<i>overpic</i>, but it's plainly little more than a convenience
over what is achievable with the do-it-yourself approach.
