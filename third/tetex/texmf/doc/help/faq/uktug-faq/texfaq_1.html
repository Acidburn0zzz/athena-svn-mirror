<H1><A NAME="SEC1">The Background</A></H1>


<H2><A NAME="QU1">What is TeX?</A></H2>

<P>
TeX is a typesetting system written by Donald E. Knuth, who
says in the Preface to his book on TeX
(see <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">TeX-related books</A>)
that it is ``<EM>intended for the creation of beautiful books -and especially for books that contain a lot of mathematics</EM>''.

<P>
Knuth developed a system of `literate programming' to write TeX,
and he provides the literate (WEB) source of TeX free of charge,
together with tools for processing the <CODE>web</CODE> source into something
that can be compiled and something that can be printed; there's never
any mystery about what TeX does.  Furthermore, the WEB system
provides mechanisms to port TeX to new operating systems and
computers; in order that one may have some confidence in the ports,
Knuth supplied a test by means of which one may judge the fidelity of
a TeX system.  TeX and its documents are therefore highly
portable.

<P>
TeX is a macro processor, and offers its users a powerful
programming capability.  For this reason, TeX on its own is a
pretty difficult beast to deal with, so Knuth provided a package of
macros for use with TeX called <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX; <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX is
effectively the minimum set of macros one can usefully employ with
TeX, together with some demonstration versions of higher-level
commands (the latter are better regarded as models than used as-is).
When people say they're ``programming in TeX'', they usually mean
they're programming in <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX.


<H2><A NAME="QU2">How should I pronounce ``TeX''?</A></H2>

<P>
The `X' stands for the Greek letter
Chi,
and is pronounced by English-speakers either a bit like the `ch' in
`loch' ([x] in the IPA) or like `k'.  It definitely is not pronounced
`ks'.


<H2><A NAME="QU3">What is METAFONT?</A></H2>

<P>
METAFONT was written by Knuth as a companion to TeX; whereas TeX
defines the layout of glyphs on a page, METAFONT defines the shapes of
the glyphs and the relations between them.  METAFONT details the sizes of
glyphs, for TeX's benefit, and details the rasters used to
represent the glyphs, for the benefit of programs that will produce
printed output as post processes after a run of TeX.

<P>
METAFONT's language for defining fonts permits the expression of several
classes of things: first (of course), the simple geometry of the
glyphs; second, the properties of the print engine for which the
output is intended; and third, `meta'-information which can
distinguish different design sizes of the same font, or the difference
between two fonts that belong to the same (or related) families.

<P>
Knuth (and others) have designed a fair range of fonts using METAFONT,
but font design using METAFONT is much more of a minority skill than is
TeX macro-writing.  The complete TeX-user nevertheless needs to
be aware of METAFONT, and to be able to run METAFONT to generate personal
copies of new fonts.


<H2><A NAME="QU4">What is MetaPost?</A></H2>

<P>
The MetaPost system implements a picture-drawing language very much like
that of METAFONT except that it outputs PostScript commands instead of
run-length-encoded bitmaps.  MetaPost is a powerful language for
producing figures for documents to be printed on PostScript printers.
It provides access to all the features of PostScript and it includes
facilities for integrating text and graphics.  (Knuth tells us that he
uses nothing else for diagrams in text that he is writing.)

<P>
Much of MetaPost's source code was copied from METAFONT's sources with
Knuth's permission.



<H2><A NAME="QU5">How can I be sure it's really TeX?</A></H2>

<P>
TeX (and METAFONT and MetaPost) are written in a
  <A HREF="texfaq_8.html#QU48">`literate' programming</A> language called Web
which is designed to be portable across a wide range of computer
systems.  How, then, is a new version of TeX checked?

<P>
Of course, any sensible software implementor will have his own suite
of tests to check that his software runs: those who port TeX and
its friends to other platforms do indeed perform such tests.

<P>
Knuth, however, provides a `conformance test' for both TeX
(<CODE>trip</CODE>) and METAFONT (<CODE>trap</CODE>).
He characterises these as `torture tests': they are designed not to
check the obvious things that ordinary typeset documents, or font
designs, will exercise, but rather to explore small alleyways off the
main path through the code of TeX.  They are, to the casual reader,
pretty incomprehensible!

<P>
Once an implementation of TeX has passed its <CODE>trip</CODE>, or and
implementation of METAFONT has passed its <CODE>trap</CODE>, test it may
reasonably be distributed as a working version.



<H2><A NAME="QU6">Are TeX and friends Y2K compliant?</A></H2>


<DL>
<DT>Crashing:
<DD>None of TeX, METAFONT or MetaPost can themselves crash
  due to any change whatever in the date of any sort.
<DT>Timestamps:
<DD>As Knuth delivers the sources, a 2-digit year is
  stored as the creation time for format files and that value is
  printed in logfiles.  These items should not be of general concern,
  since the only use of the date format file is to produce the log
  output, and the log file is designed for human readers only.

<P>
  Knuth's distributed source does not designate the code, which
  generates this 2-digit date, as a valid area where implementations
  may differ.  However, he announced in 1998 that implementators can
  alter this code without fear of being accused of non-compliance.
  Nearly all implementations that are being actively maintained had
  been modified to generate 4-digit years in the format file and the
  log, by the end of 1998.
<DT>The <CODE>\year</CODE> primitive:
<DD>Certification of a TeX
  implementation (see <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU5">trip/trap testing</A>)
  does not require that <CODE>\year</CODE> return a meaningful value (which
  means that TeX can, in principle, be implemented on platforms
  that don't make the value of the clock available to user programs).
  The <EM>TeXbook</EM> (see
  <A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">TeX-related books</A>) defines <CODE>\year</CODE> as
  ``the current year of our Lord'', which is the only correct meaning
  for <CODE>\year</CODE> for those implementations which can supply a
  meaningful value, which is to say nearly all of them.

<P>
  In short, TeX implementations should provide a value in <CODE>\year</CODE>
  giving the 4-digit year Anno Domini, or the value 1776 if the
  platform does not support a date function.

<P>
  Note that if the system itself fails to deliver a correct date to
  TeX, then <CODE>\year</CODE> will of course return an incorrect value.
  TeX cannot be considered Y2K compliant, in this sense, on a
  system that is not itself Y2K compliant.
<DT>Macros:
<DD>TeX macros can in principle perform calculations on
  the basis of the value of <CODE>\year</CODE>.
  The <A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU7">LaTeX</A> suite
  performs such calculations in a small number of places; the
  calculations performed in the current (supported) version of LaTeX are
  known to be Y2K compliant.

<P>
  Other macros and macro packages should be individually checked.
<DT>External software:
<DD>Software such as DVI translators
  needs to be individually checked.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="QU7">What is LaTeX?</A></H2>

<P>
LaTeX is a TeX macro package, originally written by Leslie Lamport, that
provides a document processing system.  LaTeX allows markup to
describe the structure of a document, so that the user
need not think about presentation. By using document classes and
add-on packages, the same document can be produced in a variety of
different layouts.

<P>
Lamport says that LaTeX
``<EM>represents a balance between functionality and ease of use</EM>''.
This shows itself as a continual conflict that leads to
the need for such as the present article: LaTeX <EM>can</EM> 
meet most user requirements, but finding out <EM>how</EM> is often
tricky.


<H2><A NAME="QU8">How should I pronounce ``LaTeX(2e)''?</A></H2>

<P>
Lamport never recommended how one should pronounce LaTeX, but a lot
of people pronounce it `Lay TeX' or perhaps `Lah TeX' (with
TeX pronounced as the program itself; see
<A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU2">the rules for TeX</A>).

<P>
The `epsilon' in `LaTeX2e' is supposed to be suggestive of a small
improvement over the old LaTeX 2.09.  Nevertheless, most people
pronounce the name as `LaTeX-two-ee'.


<H2><A NAME="QU9">Should I use <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX or LaTeX?</A></H2>

<P>
There's no straightforward answer to this question.  Many people swear
by <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX, and produce highly respectable documents using it
(Knuth is an example of this, of course).  But equally, many people
are happy to let someone else take the design decisions for them,
accepting a small loss of flexibility in exchange for a saving of
brain power.

<P>
The arguments around this topic can provoke huge amounts of noise and
heat, without offering much by way of light; your best bet is to find
out what those around you are using, and to go with the crowd.  Later
on, you can always switch your allegiance; don't bother about it.

<P>
If you are preparing a manuscript for a publisher or journal, ask them
what markup they want before you
develop your own; many big publishers have developed their own
LaTeX styles for journals and books, and insist that authors stick
closely to their markup.


<H2><A NAME="QU10">What are the AMS packages (AMS-TeX, <EM>etc</EM>.)?</A></H2>

<P>
AMS-TeX is a TeX macro package, originally written by Michael Spivak for
the American Mathematical Society (AMS) during 1983-1985. It
is described in
``<EM>The Joy of TeX</EM>'' by Michael D. Spivak (second edition,
AMS, 1990, ISBN 0-821-82997-1).  It is based on <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX, but
provides many
features for producing more professional-looking maths formulas with
less burden on authors.  It pays attention to the finer details of
sizing and positioning that mathematical publishers care about. The
aspects covered include multi-line displayed equations, equation
numbering, ellipsis dots, matrices, double accents, multi-line
subscripts, syntax checking (faster processing on initial
error-checking TeX runs), and other things.

<P>
As LaTeX increased in popularity, authors asked to submit papers to
the AMS in LaTeX, and so the AMS developed
AMS-LaTeX, which is a
collection of LaTeX packages and classes that offer authors most of
the functionality of AMS-TeX.


<H2><A NAME="QU11">What is Eplain?</A></H2>

<P>
The Eplain macro package expands on and extends the
definitions in <CODE>plain</CODE> TeX.  Eplain is not intended to provide
``generic typesetting capabilities'', as do LaTeX or
<A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU13">Texinfo</A>.
Instead, it provides definitions that are intended to be useful
regardless of the high-level commands that you use when you actually
prepare your manuscript.

<P>
For example, Eplain does not have a command <CODE>\section</CODE>,
which would format section headings in an ``appropriate'' way, as
LaTeX's <CODE>\section</CODE>.  The philosophy of Eplain is that
some people will always need or want to go beyond the macro designer's
idea of ``appropriate''.  Such canned macros are fine - as long as you
are willing to accept the resulting output.  If you don't like the
results, or if you are trying to match a different format, you are out
of luck.

<P>
On the other hand, almost everyone would like capabilities such as
cross-referencing by labels, so that you don't have to put actual page
numbers in the manuscript.  Karl Berry, the author of Eplain, says
he is not aware of any generally available macro packages that do
not force their typographic style on an author, and yet provide
such capabilities.


<H2><A NAME="QU12">What is Lollipop?</A></H2>

<P>
Lollipop is a macro package written by Victor Eijkhout; it was used in
the production of his book ``<EM>TeX by Topic</EM>'' (see
<A HREF="texfaq_2.html#QU19">Tex-related books</A>).  The manual says of
it:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Lollipop is `TeX made easy'. Lollipop is a macro package that
  functions as a toolbox for writing TeX macros.  It was my
  intention to make macro writing so easy that implementing a fully
  new layout in TeX would become a matter of less than an hour for
  an average document, and that it would be a task that could be
  accomplished by someone with only a very basic training in TeX
  programming.

<P>
  Lollipop is an attempt to make structured text formatting available
  for environments where previously only WYSIWYG packages could be
  used because adapting the layout is so much more easy with them than
  with traditional TeX macro packages.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The manual goes on to talk of ambitions to ``capture some of the
LaTeX market share''; it's a very witty package, but little sign of
it taking over from LaTeX is detectable...
An article about Lollipop appeared in <CITE>TUGboat</CITE> 13(3).


<H2><A NAME="QU13">What is Texinfo?</A></H2>

<P>
Texinfo is a documentation system that uses one source file to
produce both on-line information and printed output.  So
instead of writing two different documents, one for the on-line help
and the other for a typeset manual, you need write only one
document source file.  When the work
is revised, you need only revise one document.  You can read the
on-line information, known as an ``Info file'', with an Info
documentation-reading program.  By convention, Texinfo source file
names end with a <CODE>.texi</CODE> or <CODE>.texinfo</CODE> extension.
You can write and format Texinfo files into Info files within GNU
<I>emacs</I>, and read them using the <I>emacs</I> Info
reader.  If you do not have <I>emacs</I>, you can format Texinfo
files into Info files using <I>makeinfo</I> and read them using
<I>info</I>.

<P>
The Texinfo distribution, including a set of TeX macros for
formatting Texinfo files is available as <A HREF="ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/macros/texinfo/texinfo.tar.gz"><TT>macros/texinfo/texinfo.tar.gz</TT></A>


<H2><A NAME="QU14">If TeX is so good, how come it's free?</A></H2>

<P>
It's free because Knuth chose to make it so.  He is nevertheless
apparently happy
that others should earn money by selling TeX-based services and
products. While several valuable TeX-related tools and packages are
offered subject to restrictions imposed by the GNU General Public
Licence (`Copyleft'), TeX itself is not subject to Copyleft.

<P>
There are commercial versions of TeX available; for some users,
it's reassuring to have paid support.  What is more, some of the
commercial implementations
have features that are not available in free versions.  (The
reverse is also true: some free implementations have features
not available commercially.)

<P>
Usually, this article does not describe commercial
versions; see <A HREF="texfaq_5.html#QU40">major vendors</A> for some details.


<H2><A NAME="QU15">What is the future of TeX?</A></H2>

<P>
Knuth has declared that he will do no further development of TeX;
he will continue to fix any bugs that are reported to him (though
bugs are rare).  This decision was made soon after
TeX version 3.0 was released; at each bug-fix release
the version number acquires one more digit, so that it tends to the
limit <I>pi</I> (at the time of writing, Knuth's latest release is version
3.14159).  Knuth wants TeX to be frozen at version <I>pi</I> when he
dies; thereafter, no further changes may be made to Knuth's source.
(A similar rule is applied to METAFONT; its version number tends to the
limit <I>e</I>, and currently stands at 2.718.)

<P>
There are projects (some of them long-term
projects: see, for example,
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU117">the LaTeX3 project</A>)
to build substantial
new macro packages based on TeX.  For the even longer term, there
are various projects to build a <EM>successor</EM> to TeX; see
<A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU118">the Omega project</A> and <A HREF="texfaq_16.html#QU119">NTS</A>.


<H2><A NAME="QU16">What are TUG and <CITE>TUGboat</CITE>?</A></H2>

<P>
TUG is the TeX Users Group.  <CITE>TUGboat</CITE> is
TUG's main journal,
containing useful articles about TeX and METAFONT. TUG also produces a
newsletter for members (TeX and TUG News), organises a yearly
conference, runs training courses, sells almost all TeX-related
books, and distributes TeX-related microcomputer software on disk. 
TUG has a Technical Council to  coordinate TeX-related developments
(<A HREF="texfaq_1.html#QU18">TUG Technical Working Groups</A>).
