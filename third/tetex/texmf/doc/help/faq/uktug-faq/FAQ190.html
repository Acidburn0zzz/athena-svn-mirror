<h3>Marking changed parts of your document</h3>
<p>One often needs clear indications of how a document has changed, but
the commonest technique, "change bars", requires surprisingly much
trickery of the programmer (the problem being that TeX 'proper'
doesn't provide the programmer with any information about the
"current position" from which a putative start- or end-point of a
bar might be calculated; PDFTeX <em>does</em> provide the
information, but we're not aware yet of any programmer taking
advantage of the fact to write a PDFTeX-based changebar package).
<p>The simplest package that offers change bars is Peter Schmitt's
<i>backgrnd.tex</i>; this was written as a Plain TeX application
that patches the output routine, but it appears to work at least on
simple LaTeX documents.  Wise LaTeX users will be alerted by the
information that <i>backgrnd</i> patches their output routine, and
will watch its behaviour very carefully (patching the LaTeX output
routine is not something to undertake lightly\dots).
<p>The longest-established solution is the <i>changebar</i> package,
which uses <code>\special</code> commands supplied by the driver you're using.
You need therefore to tell the package which driver to generate
<code>\special</code>s for (in the same way that you need to tell the
<i>graphics</i> package); the list of available drivers is pretty
restricted, but does include <i>dvips</i>.  The package comes with
a shell script <i>chbar.sh</i> (for use on Unix machines) that
will compare two documents and generate a third which is marked-up
with <i>changebar</i> macros to highlight changes.
<p>The <i>vertbars</i> package uses the techniques of the
<i>lineno</i> package (which must be present); it's thus the
smallest of the packages for change bar marking, since it leaves all
the trickery to another package.
