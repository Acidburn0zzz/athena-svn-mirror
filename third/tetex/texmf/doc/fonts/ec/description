The Sauter parameter package for computer modern fonts, Version 2.4

            Ten point type is different from magnified five-point type.

John Sauter has prepared a bunch of ``alternate parameter files'' that 
make it possible to generate the Computer Modern fonts at any point size. 
I have looked at some of them and think they are pretty good (better than 
the magnified versions). With the Sauter fonts you also get things like
{\Huge $\longrightarrow$} right. The Sauter parameters are usefull in the 
range from 4 to approximately 40 pt, but become unreliable at larger sizes.

  For the design_sizes D. E. Knuth provided and described in Computers 
and Typesetting, Volume E (Computer Modern Typefaces) and for the 
additional Computer Modern math fonts supported by the AMS, the Sauter 
parameter files give exactly the same font metrics as the original
parameter files. 

  You can use the Sauter tools to interpolate between the given font sizes,
e.g. to create a cmr0950 font at 9.5pt, or to extrapolate above and below
the original sizes (and generate e.g. cmr4 or cmr25). For the nominal sizes
11, 14, 17, 20, 25, 30 and 36 we follow the ``magstep'' philosophy, i.e.
the true size is given by 10pt times an appropriate power of 1.2. If you 
prefer to create a font at 14 true pt, please name it cmr1400 to keep the
distinction. On the other hand, if you prefer magstep sizes even below 10pt
(like the msdos batch file suggests), name your font e.g. cmr0579 instead 
of cmr6. 

  No attempt is made to match the variant Computer Modern parameter files
distributed with the text1 macro package, nor any other variant parameter 
set, this includes the variants to be found in the directory knuth/local.

  In the directory mf you find the Sauter parameter files. To use them, the
following method is suggested:
(1) Create a small METAFONT file cmr0950.mf, containing the one line

design_size:=9.5; input b-cmr

(2) Run METAFONT on this file, a typical call looks like
mf "\mode=localfont; input cmr0950"

(3) Create a pk file from the gf file produced by METAFONT

With the system dependent files, this procedure can be automated.

  In the directory latex you find support for the current latex version
fonttext.cfg, fontmath.cfg, sautmath.fd, and sauttext.fd 
for LaTeX2e; they should work with any version of LaTeX2e.

  LaTeX2.09 support is found in directory obsolete:
lfonts.true is for LaTeX 2.09 with the Old Font Selection Scheme
fontdef.sau is for LaTeX 2.09 with the New Font Selection Scheme (NFSS-1)

You need to rebuild your LaTeX format in order to use the true size fonts.

  For the LaTeX fonts, the wasy symbol fonts, Alan Jeffrey's bbold fonts
and the cmcyr fonts there are additional Sauterised parameter files. The
programme files aren't bundled into this distribution, please find them 
on the TeX archive site close to you.
 
  The directories msdos, unix and vms contain support files for the 
respective operating systems, those are provided ,,as is''. In case of 
questions about them, contact the respective authors.

  The directory holin contains sauterised versions of the AMS symbol fonts 
(msam and msbm), the Ralph Smith Formal Script fonts (rsfs) and the 
Blackbord Bold Modern (bbm) fonts provided by Hubert Holin. They are 
included as they are, in case of questions contact the original author
holin@mathp7.jussieu.fr
