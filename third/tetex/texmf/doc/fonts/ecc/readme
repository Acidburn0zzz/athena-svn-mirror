What's new?
===========
As with this version 1.0, a few bugs concerning the design
parameters have been fixed, and the fonts match their OT1
and mathematical counterparts now.  Unfortunately this
resulted in changes to the font metrics.



Overview
========

`European Concrete' is an implementation of Donald
Knuth's Comcrete fonts, providing T1 text fonts and TS1
text companion fonts.

The subdirectory src contains the following METAFONT
sources:

conc??pt, coni10pt               common design parameters 
eorm5.mf       EC roman medium    5pt
eorm6.mf                          6pt
eorm7.mf                          7pt
eorm8.mf                          8pt
eorm9.mf                          9pt
eorm10.mf                        10pt
eosl9.mf       EC slanted         9pt
eosl10.mf                        10pt
eocc10.mf      EC small capitals 10pt
eoti10.mf      EC text italic    10pt
torm5.mf       TC roman medium    5pt
torm6.mf                          6pt
torm7.mf                          7pt
torm8.mf                          8pt
torm9.mf                          9pt
torm10.mf                        10pt
tosl9.mf       TC slanted         9pt      
tosl10.mf                        10pt
toti10.mf      TC italic         10pt 
tcssdc10.mf    TC Sans Serif demibold condensed 10pt

The naming scheme corresponds to J. Knappen's EC fonts:
  eo.. = textfont, T1 encoding
  to.. = text companion font, TS1 encoding

The subdirectory tfm contains tfm files for all fonts listed
above.

Installing the fonts
====================

The files from the subdirectory `src' must be moved to a
directory where METAFONT searches for its input files.  The
files from the subdirectory `tfm' must be moved to a
directory where TeX/LaTeX searches for font metrics.  In
order to generate the bitmap fonts you will need the
METAFONT sources of the EC fonts, version 1.0 or later, too.

Within EC 1.0 there is a font named `ecssdc10'.  The
corresponding tfm file `ecssdc10.tfm', however, is possibly
still missing on your computer, even if you have installed
the EC fonts.  In this case you must generate it and keep it
together with the other EC font metrics, because it may be 
needed in conjunction with the Concrete fonts.



List of FAQs
============

How can I use the EC Concrete Fonts with LaTeX?

       You need appropriate font definition files and the
       LaTeX package `ccfonts'.  You will find both on the
       CTAN in the directory
       `macros/latex/contrib/supported/ccfonts'.

Why is there a font named tcssdc10?  It does not belong to
the Concrete family.

       It is recommended to use ecssdc10 as a substitute for
       the missing bold typefaces.  At the moment (Apr.
       1997), however, its text companion counterpart
       tcssdc10 is not contained in the EC 1.0 collection,
       so I have provided it here.  (You will not need to
       install it, if you have received it with a later
       version of EC.)

Why is there no interpolation of missing design sizes?

       Knuth's original Concrete fonts do not include design
       sizes > 10pt, so we have, at the moment, no
       sufficient base for interpolation.  Do the scaled
       fonts look ugly to you?



Known bugs and deficiencies
===========================

There are no T1/TS1 versions of the `grafitti' font ccslc9.



Future changes and additions
============================

The EC Concrete fonts will reflect all future changes and
additions to J. Knappen's EC(-Modern) distribution.
