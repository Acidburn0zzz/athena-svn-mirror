By loading the ae package (\usepackage{ae}), you loose some characters
as mentioned in README. The package aecompl by Denis Roegel restores
these characters which are taken from the ec fonts. If you use pdftex,
you will get these characters as bitmaps, but this might be better than
not having them at all.

To use it, just
  \usepackage{ae,aecompl}
