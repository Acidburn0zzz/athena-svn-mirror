Version 1.0 of the AE fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a set of virtual fonts building, from the standard CM fonts,
a set of almost T1 encoded fonts. The characters missing are mainly:
eth, thorn, and the sami letter eng. Sometimes the £ character is
also missing. For the typewriter fonts, the situation is worse.

My idea with these fonts is that it should be possible to use the
exisiting Type1 versions of the CM fonts to produce PDF files even
when one needs hyphenation patterns other than English.

I want to call this a beta release, comments and suggestions are most
welcome. In particular, it would be nice to have a font containing the
missing caracters, in order to make the layout fully T1. By the way,
the name AE fonts was chosen since the fonts are Almost European
Computer Modern.

To use the fonts, simply \usepackage{ae}.

Changes since version 0.9:

* ae.sty no longer fails if the EC fonts are not installed.
* The fi-type ligatures in aecsc are fixed.

Changes since version 0.8:

* Rolf Niepraschk contributed ae.sty.
* Some character heights and depths were corrected.
