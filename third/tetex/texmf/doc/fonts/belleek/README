The contents of the original README as distributed with the Belleek fonts is
appended below (after the "--" line). Here, I want to describe how the
Belleek fonts can be used with teTeX:

  1) Run
         updmap --edit 
     This will open a config file. Th that file, replace the lines
         #! Map mt-belleek.map
         Map mt-yy.map
         Map mt-plus.map
     by the following lines:
         Map mt-belleek.map
         #! Map mt-yy.map
         #! Map mt-plus.map
     When saving the file, your map files will be remade using belleek instead of
     mathtime.

  2) go to the tex/latex/mathtime subdirectory of the main texmf tree and
     edit the files my1mtt.fd, my2mtt.fd and my3mtt.fd. In my1mtt.fd,
     remove the lines that refer to the fonts "mtmib", "mtmih", "mtmub"
     and "mtmuh". In my2mtt.fd, replace "mtsyn" by "mtsy" and remove
     the lines that refer to "mtsyb" and "mtsyh". In my3mtt.fd, remove
     the lines refer to "mtexb" and "mtexh".

That's it! Now, you can use the bellek fonts with pdftex, dvips, xdvi
and other programs. If you use LaTeX, you can use the mathtime package
to use the Belleek fonts.

-- original README:
These are the Belleek fonts described in my paper at TUG 98, the 1998 annual
meeting of the TeX Users Group.  They are drop-in replacements for the
proprietary fonts required by the LaTeX mathtime style, where the "dropping
in" process is simply to change the .fd files calling for specific fonts to
reflect the font names starting with "bl".

Notwithstanding any copyright notices in the files, these fonts have been
contributed to the public domain in their Type 1 (.pfb) and TrueType (.ttf)
forms:

    blex
    blsy
    rblmi
