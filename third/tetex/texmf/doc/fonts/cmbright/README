Description
===========
`Computer Modern Bright' is a family of sans serif fonts for
TeX and LaTeX, based on Donald Knuth's CM fonts.  It
comprises OT1, T1 and TS1 encoded text fonts of various
shapes as well as all the fonts necessary for mathematical
typesetting, incl.  AMS symbols.

CM Bright has been designed as a well legible standalone
font.  It is `lighter' and less obtrusive than CMSS, which, 
in contrast, is more appropriate for markup purposes within 
a CM Roman environment.

Together with CM Bright there comes a family of typewriter
fonts, `CM Typwewriter Light', which look better in
combination with CM Bright than the CMTT fonts would do.

Additionally this collection provides all the necessary 
files for using the fonts with LaTeX.

Installing the fonts
====================
Copy the files from the subdirectory mf of this collection
to a directory searched by METAFONT.  In a TDS compliant
file system the suitable place might be:

      texmf/fonts/source/public/cmbright/

Copy the files from the subdirectory tfm of this collection
to a directory where TeX looks for the font metrics.  In a
TDS compliant file system the suitable place might be:

     texmf/fonts/tfm/public/cmbright/

Please overwrite all existent METAFONT sources and tfm files
of previous versions:  With selective updating errors are
more likely to occur.

You will need the source files of Knuth's original CM fonts,
of the original (roman) AMS fonts, and of J. Knappen's EC
fonts, too, in order to generate the bitmaps.

IF YOU HAVE INSTALLED version 1.0, 1.0b or 1.0c, all
existent pk files named eb* and tb* (i.e. the EC versions)
at all magnifications must be removed, because the font
metrics of certain symbols have changed.

Additionally, existent pk files of version 1.0 named cmbr17
and cmbrsl17 at all magnifications must be removed..  There
will, however, be no problems when printing out existent dvi
files using these fonts.

Beta versions (< 1.0) of the fonts MUST be completely
removed.



Installing the LaTeX interface
==============================
Copy the files from the directory latex/ of this collection
to a place where you keep documented LaTeX sources or to a
temporary directory.  In case your LaTeX version is from
Dec.  1996 or newer, then run LaTeX on the installation
script cmbright.ins to unpack them, otherwise you must use
oinst.ins instead of cmbright.ins.

Then move the .sty and .fd files which have just been
generated to a directory where you keep LaTeX's style files.

The latter step is not required if your "docstrip" program
has been configured to write directly to the TeX
directories, and if the directory tex/latex/cmbright/ exists
in your TDS tree before unpacking the files.

Run LaTeX on cmbright.dtx to typeset the description of the
LaTeX package.  Run LaTeX on cmbr.fdd, too, in order to
obtain a description of the font interface and a list of all
the available font shapes.



Using the CM Bright fonts with LaTeX
====================================
For typesetting a complete document, including mathematics,
using the CM Bright and CM Typewriter Light fonts, you only
have to load cmbright.sty into LaTeX:

    \usepackage{cmbright}

Low level access (without the cmbright package) is possible,
too:  The fd files define the new font families `cmbr' and 
`cmtl', so you may request:

    \fontfamily{cmbr}\selectfont 
    \fontfamily{cmtl}\selectfont

Of course you may switch to the T1 (EC) encoding (which is
heavily recommended) and/or use the text companion symbols.

See the description of the LaTeX package (cmbright.dtx) and
the font interface (cmbr.fdd) for the details!



Problems, deficiencies and known bugs
=====================================
The CM Bright fonts are stronger degraded by an unsufficient
printer resolution than the other CM fonts.  Only at 600
dpi, relative to a design size of 10pt, a satisfying result
will be obtained, and on a 1200 dpi phototypesetter you will
see how the fonts REALLY look!  
Rendering at 300dpi may even result in Metafont errors,
affecting fine details of certain letters.  See also the FAQ
(2) below!

The placing of the accent \t (tie-after) is bad.  (Did you
ever need it?)

The semibold font series is not available with OT1 encoding.

There is no `caps and small caps' font shape; see FAQ (4) 
below!

There are nor CM Bright math fonts for the (coming) `New 
Math Font Setup' yet, so the `cmbright' package cannot be 
used in conjunction with `newmath',

See the description of the cmbright package for some special
problems concerning the LaTeX interface only!



Future changes
==============
Minor changes and/or bug fixes to the T1/TS1 fonts are still
to be expected.

All future changes, bug fixes and additions to the 
`official' EC fonts will be adopted, if appropriate.

The source files will be reorganized.  At the moment they 
contain lots of unnecessary and redundant code.




FAQs
====
(1) With CM Sans Serif the new EC fonts are sometimes very
much different from the traditional ones.  What about CM
Bright?

   There have been some small aesthetical refinements, but
   the width and the weight of the fonts have not been
   changed (except for some mathematical symbols), so you
   should not encounter any problems when upgrading to the
   T1 encoding.  (With J. Knappen's EC fonts, too, the
   mathematical symbols in the T1/TS1 fonts are different
   from those in the traditional fonts.)

(2) Can I use the CM Bright fonts with a 300 dpi printing
engine?

   With large font sizes this is no problem at all.  At
   10...12pt, however, the only advice which can be given,
   is:  Try it out!  At lower sizes certain letters may be
   corrupt; problems are known to occur with the caret
   accent at 8pt and below.

(3) Typesetting a complete book using the CM Bright fonts,
how would that look?

   See the Proceedings of the Ninth European TeX Conference
   (1995).  The fonts used were a beta release of CM Bright;
   the small sizes (< 10pt) have been improved very much in
   the meantime.  The book was printed at 600dpi.

(4) Help! CM Bright does not provide `small capitals'.

   Company names, acronyms, trade marks and similar material
   may be typeset capitalized.  In order to make the result
   less obtrusive, the font size should be one `step'
   smaller than the surrounding text.  A `quick and dirty'
   way to make LaTeX perform this task is the following
   style file `smcaps.sty'.  It defines the new command
   \textc{..}, which may be used in place of \textsc{..}:

   \ProvidesPackage{smcaps}
   \DeclareRobustCommand{\sm@ller}{%
      \dimen@\f@size\p@
      \ifdim \dimen@ > 12\p@
        \dimen@=0.83333\dimen@
      \else
        \advance \dimen@ -\p@
      \fi
      \math@fontsfalse
      \fontsize{\the\dimen@}\z@
      \selectfont
      }
   \newcommand{\textc}[1]{{\sm@ller\uppercase{#1}}}
   % end of smcaps.sty


(5) Why do the EC Bright fonts not support font size 
interpolation?

   This would require more native design sizes than I have
   provided.  Furthermore, certain design parameters have
   been optimized for the sizes currently available and the
   corresponding magnifications.

  the restrictions mentioned above.



History
=======
*** 1998-12-11 ***

   cmbright.sty v6.7:  Fixed the math font setup, so that
   \mathbold acts on lowercase greek, too.
   fonts v1.0e: improved Euro symbol (the metrics remain
   unchanged!)
   
*** 1998-02-02 ***

   fd files v7.3: font sizes 29.86 and 35.83 pt suppprted

*** 1998-01-28 ***

   Fixed this document: Pointed out that rendering at 300dpi
   may cause Metafont problems.

*** 1998-01-19 ***

   Fixed cmbright.ins to prevent problems with Unix (teTeX):
   Do not generate uppercase filenames automatically.
   cmbright.ins now TDS-enabled.  
   Added oinst.ins for LaTeX  < Dec.1996.

*** 1997-09-11 ***

   cmbright.sty v6.6: added \relax after \ProcessOptions,
   removed spurious spaces in font definitions

   fd files v7.2: forced \hyphenchar\font45 in OT1 fonts,
   removed spurious spaces in font definitions

   included the new installation script, which was
   erroneously lacking in the previous distribution :-(
   
*** 1997-06-03 ***

   fixed a bug in the installation script:  the fd files are
   now generated with mixed-case names if necessary (i.e.
   when running an obsolete LaTeX release on Unix)

   fonts, v1.0d: corrected height of arithmetic symbols in
   T1/TS1 fonts;

*** 1997-05-26 *** 

   Fonts, v1.0c:  changed lowercase hachek accent in order
   to avoid METAFONT errors occurring with certain MF modes;
   fixed `root' symbol and big circles in TS1 fonts;
   corrected rule_width# in semibold fonts, which had been
   larger than it is in the bx fonts;

*** 1997/05/22 ***

   fd files v7.0: lowercase filenames

   fonts v1.0b:  br17pt.mf fixed (o#, apex_o#)

   cmbright.sty v6.4:  minor fixes

   enhanced documentation

*** 1996/11/20 ***

   Documentation update only,  e-mail address added.

*** 1996/07/02 ***

   cmbright.sty, v6.2:  The code for selecting font size and
   \baselineskip has been basically changed.  The default
   font sizes defined in the class file will no longer be
   changed.  The size macros like \normalsize will no longer
   be redefined.  Same font sizes will always get the same
   leading:
  
   size    \baselineskip
    8pt    10.00pt
    9pt    11.25pt
   10pt    12.50pt
   11pt    13.70pt
   12pt    15.00pt

   A new option [standard-baselineskips] enables you to
   suppress the enlarged \baseselineskip values.

   The commands \textregistered, \pounds, \textsterling and
   \mathsterling have been made working; they will use the
   roman text font.

   font definition files, v6.0:  In all .fd files octal
   numbers have been changed to decimal ones, in order to
   avoid conflicts with possibly active quote characters.

   fonts, v1.0:  erroneous comments fixed

*** 1996/05/02 ***

   fonts:                    version 1.0
   font definition files:            5.0
   LaTeX package `cmbright':         5.0

   The first `final' release, including the AMS fonts.
