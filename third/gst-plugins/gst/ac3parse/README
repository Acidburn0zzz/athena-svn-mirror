AC3 Audio Parser
================

This element parses out ac3 audio data.  It's based heavily on the
mp3parse element, with some minor changes to calculate frame sizes for ac3
instead of mp3.

It will take an mpeg audio stream in any form on its 'src' input, with any
buffer size, and split it into buffers containing a single frame each.
NOTE: ancillary data is not dealt with right now.
