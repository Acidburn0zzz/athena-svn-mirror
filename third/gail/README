This directory contains the GAIL library.

Dependencies
============

In order to get CVS gail installed on your system, you need to have
the most recent CVS versions of gtk+ and libgnomecanvas installed as well.
Note that  gtk+ requires glib/pango/atk and libgnomecanvas also requires
libart, pangoft2 and gnome-common. 

Building
========

To compile a CVS version of gail on your system, you will need to take
several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these
steps at once by running:

        cvsroot/gail# ./autogen.sh

Basically this does the following for you:

        cvsroot/gail# aclocal; automake; autoconf

        The above commands create the "configure" script.  Now you
        can run the configure script in cvsroot/gail to create all
        the Makefiles.

Before running autogen.sh or configure, make sure you have libtool
in your path.

Note that autogen.sh runs configure for you.  If you wish to pass
options like --prefix=/usr to configure you can give those options
to autogen.sh and they will be passed on to configure.
