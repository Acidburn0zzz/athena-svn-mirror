README file for building Cygnus Network Security
================================================================

1) unpack the sources; the top level directory will be referred to as ${srcdir}
2) if you have gnu make, create a build directory somewhere, and refer to it
   as ${builddir}; if you don't, builddir should be the same as srcdir.
3) cd ${builddir}; ${srcdir}/configure # can be relative
4) make depend
5) make all
6) make install DESTDIR=${builddir}/DESTDIR  # must be absolute

Now, ./DESTDIR has a usr/kerberos tree. Tar it up and save it -- this
is an installation kit. (tar cf krb-${host}.tar -C DESTDIR usr/kerberos)
