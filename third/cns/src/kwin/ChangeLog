	* kwin.h:  Avoid including mit-copyright.h; this avoids a build
	error.  But also, avoid claiming copyright; make it PD.
	* kwin.c:  Avoid <0 test of strlen result.
	* makefile (RFLAGS):  There's no /nologo for "rc".
	(LFLAGS):  Skip /nologo, for shorter command line.
	(kwin.exe):  Avoid line-too-long crap by copying long-named
	libraries, and linking them under very short names.
