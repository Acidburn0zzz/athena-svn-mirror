 	hppa1.1 (since we only care about the os, not the cpu.)

Mon Oct 23 14:28:16 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	* patchlevel.h: add CNS4_RELEASE label for identification.

Fri Sep  1 15:38:11 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Moved rdist configuration after selection of
	target makefile fragment.  Extract setting of CC from makefile
	fragments, and put the result into the environment.  Define new
	variable xdmsubdirs, and if --enable-xdm is given, include it in
	subdirs.

Wed Jul 19 15:54:06 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Put -DIGNORE_IP_ADDRESS in enabledefs if
	--disable-ip-address-validation was given.  Define ENABLEDEFS to

	file from the driver subdir, to the binary release.  Add
	README file which points to mac.txt and mac.html.

Thu Feb  9 00:55:58 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at om.toad.com)

	* Makefile.in (install-mac):  Commands to build a floppy/stuffit
	directory for a Mac release.
	(dist-mac):  Dummy that says to do it on the Mac.
	(unixmac):  Build the mac doc in the doc directory in this step.

Sat Feb  4 10:00:00 1995 John Rivlin <jrivlin@fusion.com> 

	* Makefile.in: Changed kerbdist.zip to cns95q1.zip
	to match the documentation. Excluded doc/cvs directory
	from kerbsrc.zip file.

Thu Feb  2 13:55:46 1995  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: Don't try to build rdist on mips*-pyramid-osx*.

	wintel/wintel and wintel/include directories.

Tue Jan 10 20:36:54 1995  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in (newsrcdir): set newsrcdir to . rather than blank,
	so that it works in the local case as well.

Thu Jan  5 20:25:25 1995  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in (common portion): If appl/rdist subdirectory is
	present, and we're not configuring for a windows or mac host,
	configure the appl/rdist subdirectory.  It has to be handled
	specially because Cygnus configure assumes everything listed in
	$configdirs is one level down from the current directory.

Thu Dec 15 16:21:29 1994  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@sanguine.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in (othersubdirs): Add appl/ftp, appl/ftp/ftp, and

	(site.exp, check): New targets.

Sat Nov 12 00:30:32 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (all-windows, clean-windows):  Recurse into wintel.
	(ZIPFILES, ZIPBINARYFILES):  Zap all the binary crap except .ICO's.
	(makefile-windows):  Use large model for wconfig.c, since the
	rest of our build needs large model, and no other parts needs
	small.

Fri Nov 11 03:28:25 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (ZIPFILES, ZIPBINARYFILES, kerbsrc.zip):  Incorporate
	wintel subdir into Windows Telnet zip file.

Fri Nov  4 02:38:12 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (ZIPFILES):  Remove configuration files, etc, that
	are now one directory up.  FIXME, we should capture doc and readme
	in such a DOS ZIP source archive.

	* All Makefile.in files: Use $(S) after $(C) and $(srcdir).

	* README, config.guess, config.sub, configure, move-if-change:
	Move to top level directory.
	* configure.in: Change srctrigger to Makefile.in.  Use
	package_makefile_frag rather than common_makefile_frag.  Use code
	in post-target: rather than postfix_makefile_frag.  Generalize the
	targets names slightly.  Add code to override SUBDIRS, since that
	is no longer done by configure.  Use mpw* rather than mac*.

Mon Oct  3 15:34:28 1994  Ken Raeburn  <raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com>

	* configure.in (alpha-dec-osf*): Handle all versions the same for
	now.

	* config.guess: Updated Alpha OSF1 handling from FSF's
	config.guess.

Tue Aug 9 12:00:00 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* Makefile.in: Removed kerbconf.zip as it is no longer
	used.

	* Makefile.in: Kuser will no longer be supported under
	Windows in favor of kwin.  Thus all references to
	kuser have been removed. 

	* Makefile.in: Added lib/kadm to the following targets:
	all-windows, clean, ren2long, kerbsrc.zip, makefile-windows.
	Also krb_err.h and kadm_err.h now get constructed using awk
	during kerbsrc.zip, as they are required on PC.
	Clean-windows target now cleans the constructed makefiles
	so they don't get ported back to unix by accedent.
	Also added kwin to kerbsrc.zip and ZIPBINARYFILES to 
	handle binary transfers.

Fri Sep 16 15:41:35 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm@majipoor.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: Change rule for makefile target unixmac: so
	that it redefines make variable $S (file path seperator) to be
	correct for unix (configured already for Mac) before executing
	unix make on the makefile in the include directory.

Wed Sep 14 14:26:46 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* configure: change email address for configure problems to
	network-security@cygnus.com just in case.

Thu Sep  1 17:48:00 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: clean up dead rules, excess mkdirs, excess
	assignments.

Fri Aug 12 17:34:36 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* build-all: update canth SCO entry to not specify host.
	* configure.in: allow for -hpux[89] specifiers
	* build-all: explicitly distinguish hpux 8 and hpux 9 machines
	(the code doesn't care, but the binaries are different.)

Thu Aug 11 16:08:17 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* build-all: reasonable default arguments, document what platform
	we think each build is for, and use new build-krb arguments.

	* build-krb: add --latest, --progressive, --native, make=...
	and default to progressive or latest make if available. Include
	more information in the log as well. Also add --bin-ld to pass
	-B/bin/ to gcc so it gets shared (ie. libc w/resolver) libraries.

Thu Aug 11 03:59:18 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in: propagate DBG from the toplevel.

	Added README file to kerbsrc.zip target.

Fri Jul 8 02:40:54 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)
	
	* makefile.in: Updated file with portable directory syntax for PC.

	Added ##DOS lines which are comments which will be removed by the 
	wconfig program when it is run on the PC.  This will serve as a
	substitute for the configure process on the PC.

	Got clean: target working on PC.
	
	Added makefile-windows: target on PC to allow configure process
	to take place automatically. (nmake -f makefile.in WHAT=windows)
	will build the makefiles and the system from scratch.

	Added krbsrc.zip: target to get zip file built on unix with all 
	necessary components.

	Added krbconf.zip: target temporarily.  Same as krbsrc.zip but with
	unix names.

Fri Jul  1 05:04:27 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	avoid dependency loop.

Mon Jun 20 23:51:37 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (all-windows):  Simple script for building all dirs.
	(all):  Just call $(ALL_WHAT).
	(all-unix):  Renamed from original "all" rule.
	* configure.in (windows sed script):  Handle quoting of
	ORGANIZATION macro in Windows shell.
	* build-krb:  Use make depend again, to be sure it works.

Sat Jun 18 08:34:18 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Makefile.in (crlogin):  Rename to cygin.
	* mac-mf.sed:  Use Delete -i -y to provide for no error on missing
	file, as well as no questions asked.

Fri Jun 17 03:48:42 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	on Unix before the user moves the tree to MS-Windows to finish it.
	(install):  typo.
	* configure.in (subdirs):  Remove lib/knet and appl/knetd, unused.
	(winsubdirs, macsubdirs):  New shortlists of the only dirs needed
	on these client platforms.
	(final cleanup):  Don't substitute slashes in sed's arguments.
	Allow @ to precede .o (->.obj) to properly convert $@.o.
	Comment the sed secipt that makes us acceptable to NMAKE.

Fri May 20 01:15:06 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* configure.in:  Second cut at handling Windows.  Also insert
	a hook for Mac MPW handling.
	* build-krb:  Hack `-' args that got broken up by spaces.  FIXME,
	this is the wrong way to fix this.  Be slightly more verbose.
	Avoid error from mkdir.  Remove entire DESTDIR before make
	install, to avoid permission problems on read-only files.  Don't
	do a make depend, just clean/all/install; it ought to work now.

	* Makefile:  Remove; Makefile.in is the master makefile here.
	* Makefile.in: Replace {} with () for Microsoft NMAKE.
