.SH NAME
tftpd \- server tftp daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B /etc/tftpd
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Tftpd
is a daemon which runs the trivial file transfer protocol server for the
MIT Internet software.  It listens for incoming connections, and forks a
child to perform each requested transfer.  It uses the directory
.IR /tftpd ;
the file
.I lock
in that directory is used to prevent two daemons from becoming
active simultaneously; it also contains the daemon's process ID,
which is used by the tftp command program
.IR tcom (8)
to control the daemon's operation.
