	* mt-win: Added support for kstream library.

Tue Aug 9 12:00:00 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* common: Added space at end of line per comment for Mac 

	* ren.msg: Added mt-dgux88 and mt-pyramid translation.

	* mt-win: SERVER_KADM_SRCS and SERVER_KADM_OBJS added to allow

Thu Sep  1 17:49:15 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* common: support prefix; eliminate lint.

Fri Aug 26 16:43:31 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@rtl.cygnus.com)

	* mt-dgux88k, mt-hp300: set NO_SYSIO to indicate an svr4 system

Mon Jul 25 18:34:13 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* mt-sun (TARGET_CDEFS): use POSIX_TERMIOS.

Thu Jul 21 18:43:11 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* mt-spsol (TARGET_CDEFS): don't define NSIG (especially to the
	wrong value) since Solaris now provides it (2.3 and up.)

Wed Jul 20 20:40:35 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@cygnus.com)

	* mt-pyramid, mt-dgux88k: new files. Based on svr4.

Tue Jul 19 16:59:57 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* common (USRDIR): Needs $(S).

Fri Jul 15 02:40:54 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* ren.msg: Added for PC name mapping

Fri Jul 8 02:40:54 1994  John Rivlin  (jrivlin@fusion.com)

	* common: Add $(R) $(C) $(S) $(U) directory syntax variables
	to facilitate native builds on DOS.  No "/" characters may
	be used in file names as configure is no longer run on unix
	for the DOS product.  The added variables are now used throughout
	the system in place of "/" characters.

	Added WHAT variable which indicates the current machine environment.
	This allows separate targets to be created for different machines in
	makefiles.

	SRCTOP and BUILDTOP are now assumed to have a trailing "\".  This
	facilitates our machine independent naming on the Mac.

	ORGANIZATION removing further pre-processing requirements.  This
	is now implemented with an include file called org.h.

	OBJEXT and EXEEXT added for portability. "." is required for EXEEXT
	so that unix may be accomodated where no extension is present.

	* mt-win: Added $(R), $(C), $(S) and $(U) and applied them (see above)
	Also added WHAT

	Changed DBG flags to compile with Large model

	Added variables do define RM, MV and CP commands for portability

	RMLIB variable added to allow ar step to skipped completely as this
	is done during compilation under windows.  this is done because there
	is no easy way to form a dll directly from a long list of .obj files
	without putting them in a library first.  Also they can't be put in a
	library easily and reliable from a list.

	Added rule to build c files so that library step can be performed.
	(see above)

Wed Jun 22 21:24:36 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* mt-alpha (TARGET_CDEFS): Do define POSIX; don't define
	NEED_SYS_ERRLIST.

Wed Jun 22 20:35:29 1994  Mark Eichin  (eichin@tweedledumber.cygnus.com)

	* mt-vaxvms (SRVTAB_FILE): incomplete target file, to record
	SRVTAB_FILE value for now.

Tue Jun 21 16:38:27 1994  Ken Raeburn  (raeburn@cujo.cygnus.com)

	* mt-alpha (TARGET_CDEFS): Don't use "-trapuv", since we currently
	default to using gcc.

Tue Jun 21 00:08:22 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* mt-win (TARGET_CDEFS):  Remove -DWINDOWS; we're using _WINDOWS
	now, which is provided by the compiler.
	(DBG_LIB):  Needs -GD option for DLL code generation.  Add -G2
	to optimize a bit.

Sat Jun 18 09:14:05 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Make DES library independent of Kerberos library.

	* common (DES_LIBDEP):  Remove link of libkrb after libdes.
	(Didn't work on Mac, and this way is cleaner.)
	* mt-* (DES_TIME_SRCS, DES_TIME_OBJS):  Define the time-handling
	glue file for the DES library, in each configuration.

Fri Jun 17 04:58:03 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* mt-mac:  Make library building really work.  Also, link
	programs.  Don't override RM, which is needed to build unixmac
	while configuring the tree; instead, have mac-mf.sed change
	it while building the MPW MakeFile.

Thu Jun 16 16:43:24 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* common (INCLUDEFLAGS):  Avoid faking out MPW conversion scripts.
	* mt-mac:  Many revs to make the tree build on Mac.

Wed Jun 15 16:41:10 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* common (DES_LIBDEP):  DES library now also needs krb library
	when linking with it, since it uses code from the *_glue.c routines.
	* mt-mac (REALMDBSRCS, REALMDBOBJS):  Use mac_store.c.
	(CACHESRCS, CACHEOBJS):  Use memcache.c, not mac_store.c.

Mon Jun 13 14:58:41 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* mt-386bsd, mt-386svr4, mt-alpha, mt-decstation, mt-hp300,
	mt-i960vx, mt-irix4, mt-irix5, mt-linux, mt-next, mt-rsaix,
	mt-sco, mt-snake, mt-spsol, mt-sun:  Add LIB_KRB_HOSTSRCS and
	LIB_KRB_HOSTOBJS, containing unix_glue.

	* mt-386svr4, mt-snake, mt-spsol:  Move -DUSE_RAND48 from Makefile
	to .h file.

Wed Jun  8 23:28:33 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* common (DBG_LIB):  Add flags for compiling libraries.
	* mt-win (CACHESRCS, CACHEOBJS):  Implement memory cacheing.
	(SETENVSRCS, SETENVOBJS):  Set to null.
	(DELIVERABLES, INSTALL_DELIVERABLES):  Eliminate.
	(ALL_WHAT, INSTALL_WHAT):  New variables to fix problems
	in `make all' and `make install' in lib/krb.
	(DBG_LIB):  Add space optimization to avoid 64K limit.
	(DBG):  Add stack size setting to avoid clobbering printf globals.

Fri May 27 17:16:30 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* mt-win (STRCASE*):  Add strcasecmp to needed Windows files.
	(KRB_LIB, DES_LIB, etc):  Override library name to kerberos.dll
	and kerberos.lib.  Eliminate DES_LIB except for when building
	kerberos.dll.
	(DBG):  Fix up memory model flags.
	(SYS_LIBS):  Move winsock.lib from include to lib/krb.

Wed May 25 09:08:47 1994  D V Henkel-Wallace  (gumby@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* common (GLOBAL_CDEFS): should include NOENC_FLAG

Sat May 21 04:41:28 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* common (MAKE):  Remove; don't override it.
	* mt-win:  Set CACHE* for no ticket storage.
	(DBG):  Specify -mq for QuickWin terminal interface when linking.
	* mt-386svr4, mt-hp300, mt-snake, mt-spsol:  Pull NO_SETPRIORITY,
	which is now in the c-*.h files.  Clean up a few comments.

Thu May 19 21:41:06 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* common (LIBEXT):  Set the extension for libraries, and use it.
	(CFLAGS_LINK):  Provide the subset of C compiler flags that
	are used when only linking.  This reduces command line size
	to work with DOS NMAKE.
	* mt-win:  Add library handling.  Improve debug flags, add
	small Windows DLL memory model flag.  Avoid building server
	objects in both the KRB and DES libraries.  Cause the winsock
	library to be linked into applications.
	* mt-mac:  Avoid building server objects in both the KRB and DES
	libraries.  Patch library handling -- but it isn't really working.

Sat May 14 01:01:26 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* mt-win:  Add specs for LIB_KRB_HOSTSRCS and SERVERSIDESRCS
	(and their OBJS) for Windows environment.
	* mt-mac:  New config file for Macintosh client support.

Fri May 13 02:40:54 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	Move many -D specifications into *.h files instead of 
	the compiler command line.  This shortens the line, which
	is required due to lossage in MSDOS.

	* common:  Rename INCLUDE to INCLUDEFLAGS, since environment
	variable INCLUDE overrides the compiler's header file path.
	(GLOBAL_CDEFS, DBMFLAG):  Move BYTEORDER and DBMFLAG to
	../include/c-*.h.
	{}:  Replace with () for Microloss NMAKE.
	mt-*:  Move HOST_BYTE_ORDER, KERBEROS, VFS, USE_UNISTD_H,
	HIDE_RUSEROK, HAVE_GETENV, DO_REVERSE_RESOLVE.

	* mt-win:  New config file for Microsoft Windows 3.1.
