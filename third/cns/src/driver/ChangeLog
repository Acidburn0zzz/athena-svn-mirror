	* %Kerberos Client Preferences:  Check in a default Preferences
	file, which matches the src/prototypes config files.

Wed Feb  8 14:34:15 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* MakeFile (all):  Build "CNS Kerberos".

Wed Feb  1 01:36:05 1995  John Gilmore  (gnu at toad.com)

	* MakeFile:  Add rule to build the driver as "CNS Kerberos" as
	well as the existing name "DriverShellAll.think" from Julia.
	"CNS Kerberos" is now what the documentation in
	doc/developer-notes.texinfo says to build.

Wed Oct 12 00:41:19 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* driverInstall.a: Fixed typo in ReturnA4.

Tue Oct 11 10:36:30 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm at toad.com)

	* Driver.c (main): Remove old function prototypes for DES routines.
	Include Des.h, Comment memory allocation scheme.  Remove Sysbeep
	and debugger trap debugging code. Add code to process driver
	control calls for setting local realm, getting name instance
	and realm of the principal in the current ticket file,
	cKrbCacheInitialTicket, cKrbGetAuthForService, getting number
	of and nth sessions, deleting one or all sessions, setting the
	password, and returning DES pointers to calling applications.
	* Driver.h: Use correct C comments.
	* driverInstall.a (ReturnA4): Return value of register that
	points to driver globals for use by applications calling the DES
	routine pointers.
	* driverInstall.c (main): Remove superfluous comments.

Wed Sep 14 12:15:48 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm@cygnus.com) 

	* Driver.c (main): Casts for stricter type checking.
	Process additional driver control calls, to add and delete realm
	maps and server maps, and to return nth server or realm map.

	* Makefile: Fix typo in instructions output to user while building
	the driver.

Tue Sep 13 17:20:42 1994  Julia Menapace  (jcm@cygnus.com)

	* c_mac.h (MULTIDIMENSIONAL_ERR_TXT): Added placeholder for
	compile time flag set in mac binary project file.

Fri Jul  1 08:22:13 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@cygnus.com)

	* Driver.c:  Remove references to isname, isinst, isrealm.
	Remove non-ASCII (C) symbol so file will appear to be text.
	* MakeFile:  Put header on it so Intercon NFS won't think the file
	is non-text.  Add "assembly" target.  Lowercase "kerberos.r".
	Avoid deleting the driver and LoadDriver when building the final
	object.  Add "echo" to remind to copy to Extensions folder.
	* kerberos.r:  Include "Kerberos.rsrc", not "kerberos.rsrc".
	* ShowINIT.a:  Add missing assembler language file.

Fri Jul  1 05:37:23 1994  John Gilmore  (gnu@tweedledumb.cygnus.com)

	* Create driver directory and populate it with initial working
	Macintosh Kerberos driver.  Pieces from KClient,  the rest by Julia
	Menapace and John Gilmore.
