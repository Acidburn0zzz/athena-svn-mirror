Description: Cygnus Network Security Version 4
  CNS is based on MIT Kerberos V4 but has many additions and
  improvements over the MIT V4 patchlevel 10 release, including the
  use of GNU-style configure, much better portability, and the
  inclusion of several new "kerberized" packages (rdist, ftp, telnet.)
