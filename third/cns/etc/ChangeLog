Thu Nov 30 16:39:54 1995  Mark Eichin  <eichin@cygnus.com>

	config.guess and run buildcns4.
	* packageme4: ditto for packagecns4.
	* getpackagecns4: interim script for renaming packages after
	manual "make taz-bin". Will eventually be deleted.
	* hostloop: script. hardcoded for Mountain View site, reads a list
	of hostnames, and if there's enough diskpace on /deneb/offsite,
	uses rsh to build and packge on each.
