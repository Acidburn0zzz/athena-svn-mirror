The Purpose of This Release

	This patch release contains approximately one hundred (100) bug 
	fixes for the OSF/Motif 1.2 source code base. The number of
	Change Requests (CRs) resolved for this release is approximately
	one hundred and fifty (150).  All fixes were implemented in the
 	./lib/Xm source code.

	This patch release contains source code addressing defects reported
	against versions up through Release 1.2.4.  In addition, this patch
	release includes new functionality and enhancements to converge the
	OSF/Motif source code with the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) 1.0
	version of Motif.  Please refer to the section of this document
	entitled "New Functionality and Enhancements to support the
	Common Desktop Environment (CDE)".

	The reference platforms for Motif 1.2.5 are the HP 9000/720
	running HP-UX 9.01 and an Intel 486 workstation running OSF/1
	1.2.

	Motif 1.2.5 is 64-bit clean using the DEC Alpha OSF/1
	V1.3 Rev. 111 as the test platform.

	OSF encourages the reporting of all bugs found in OSF/Motif
	regardless of the platform or hardware configuration in which
	the bug is found.  However, OSF will commit to accept (and
	repair according to priority) only those bugs that can be
	replicated on the current reference configurations.  A list of
	known bugs can be found in the OPENBUGS file and a list of
	bugs fixed in this release can be found in the CLOSEDBUGS file,
	both on the release media.

	In addition, OSF has added a list of bugs that we do not intend 
	to fix.  These bugs can be found in the WILLNOTFIXBUGS file.  In 
	the majority of cases, the reason we do not intend to fix these 
	bugs is because doing so would create larger problems for our
        Motif Software Support subscribers.

	Since this is a general availability product release, it has
	undergone the full quality assurance cycle at OSF.


Installing This Release

	OSF/Motif 1.2.5 is provided on magnetic tape, in tar format.

	This release is made up of a "sparse tree" of files that have
	changed since patch release 1.2.4. The new versions of the
	files should replace the corresponding Motif 1.2.4 versions of
	the files in your source tree, and then the Makefiles and then
	the binaries should be rebuilt.


	Before you install this release, you must have installed patch
	releases 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3 and 1.2.4. 

	To install the entire contents of the tape, create the directory
	that you want to be the root for the sources, make that the current 
	directory, load the tape into the tape drive, and issue this 
	command:

		tar xvf device_name

	After the tape is unloaded, you can use, for example, the cp -f
	command to copy the sources from the current directory into
	your source tree.


	These release creates the following new files under ./lib/Xm 
	directory:

	ColorObj.c
	ColorObj.h
	ColorObjP.h
	DtHash.c
	Hash.c
	HashP.h

        All changes made in this release are fixes for reported bugs.
        For details on the bugs fixed, see the file CLOSEDBUGS on this
        tape.


Overview of the Motif Directory Structure

	This section describes the Motif directory structure.

	This file, ./README-1.2.5, summarizes the contents of the top
	level directories in the directory structure, briefly
	describes the build process, and describes bug reporting
	procedures.

	The file ./BUGREPORT is a bug report template.

	The file ./OPENBUGS contains all open bugs.

	The file ./CLOSEDBUGS contains all bugs fixed in this
	release.

	The file ./WILLNOTFIXBUGS contains all bugs that OSF will 
	not fix.

	The directory ./X11R5 contains official MIT patches for
	Version 11 of the X Window System.  The patches to the Xlib
	and the X Toolkit Intrinsics are required for building and
	running Motif 1.2.5.  The file ./X11R5/README describes the
	patches and how to apply them to your X sources.  For more
	information, refer to the section "Building Motif On Your
	System."

	Note:  No new X11R5 patch is needed for this release.
	       MIT, not OSF, is responsible for support
	       of any patches in the ./X11R5 directory.
	       We provide them unsupported for the
	       convenience of users who might not yet
	       have received the latest sources.

	The directory ./doc contains the full sources for the Motif
	documentation. A new file, CDElibXm.ps, is postscript format
	document.  This document was developed and donated by external
	CDE/Motif Pre-Structured Technology (PST) providers.  It 
	describes the new functionality and enhancements provided
	in this release to support the Common Desktop Environment (CDE).

	The directory ./lib contains the toolkit library and resource
	manager library:

	   * ./lib/Xm contains the Motif widget library.

	   * ./lib/Mrm contains the Motif resource manager
	     library used with the uil compiler.

	The directory ./bindings contains vendor-specific bindings for
	virtual keysyms.  For more information on virtual bindings,
	see the file ./bindings/README or the VirtualBindings(3X)
	manual page in the OSF/Motif Programmer's Reference.

	The directory ./clients contains the Motif window manager, the
	User Interface Language (uil) compiler, and the xmbind client:

	   * ./clients/uil contains the uil compiler and the
	     callable uil interface library (libUil.a).

	   * ./clients/mwm contains the Motif window manager.

	   * ./clients/xmbind contains a client used to set up
	     the bindings between keys on the keyboard and Motif
	     virtual keys.

	The directory ./demos is an unsupported directory.

	The directory ./tools contains a single tools subdirectory,
	wml, with the Widget Meta-Language (WML) facility.

	The directory ./config contains configuration files.

Building Motif for Your System

	Please refer to the Release Notes, Chapter 6, or the section
	"Building Motif for Your System" in the README-1.2.1 file, for
	more information.

	Be sure to read the section "Tailoring the Build Process" for
	information on how to configure your system before building
	Motif.  This section includes instructions for patching your
	X11R5 sources.  The section "Motif Makefiles" describes the
	steps you should follow to build the source, including
	building the Makefiles, after you have tailored your build
	configuration.  The section "The Motif Build Tree" indicates
	how the build proceeds once it has begun.

	Motif 1.2.5 uses X11R5 Xlib and X Toolkit Intrinsics
	libraries.  The versions of these libraries used to build
	Motif must have the MIT fixes 1-26, supplied in the ./X11R5
	directory, applied to them in order for Motif to build and run
	properly.  Please read the README in that directory for more
	discussion of the patches.


	At OSF we have found the following sequence of commands
        to be most convenient:

	cd $MTOP
	make Makefile 
	make Makefiles 
	make includes			
	make depend
	make -k
	
	The above "make includes" step is critical, otherwise the old
	header files will still be included, potentially resulting in
	compiler errors and undefined results.

	You can perform the entire make process by issuing one of the
        following commands from the top of the Motif source tree:

        make World "BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS=-IXTop/X11"

        or

        make Everything "BOOTSTRAPCFLAGS=-IXTop/X11"

        The difference between these commands is that the World
        target removes all object files from the tree.  You may
        prefer to use make Everything after changing some
        settings in the configuration files.

	To install Motif libraries, clients, and header files,
        use the command make install from the top of the Motif
        tree.


Readiness for Certification

	The Motif Validation Test Suite	(VTS) version 1.1.1 was used to 
	verify the quality of this release on the following configurations:

	   * Intel 486 running OSF/1 1.2, MIT R5 server

	   * HP 9000/720 running HP-UX 9.01, R5 server

	   * SPARCstation 2 running SunOS 4.1.2, R5 server

	   * DEC Alpha running DEC OSF/1 V1.3 Rev. 111, R5 server


New Functionality and Enhancements to support the Common Desktop 
Environment (CDE)

	This release includes new functionality and enhancements to
	converge OSF/Motif 1.2 source code with the Common Desktop 
	Environment's version of Motif. 

	New Functionality:

	* Complete localization of toolkit error messages
	
	* XmGetPixmap() and XmGetPixmapByDepth() use the environmental variable
	  XMICONSEARCHPATH or XMICONBMSEARCHPATH as the icon search path. If
	  neither of these variables is set, then they use XBLANGPATH, which
	  is the OSF/Motif behavior.


	Enhancements:

	* Optionally allowing mouse button 2 on a three-button mouse to be used
	  to extend the current selection. This is equivalent to the OPEN LOOK 
	  Adjust function.

	* Allowing Tab to be used to move through a group of PushButton widgets
	  and gadgets, ArrowButton widgets and gadgets, and DrawnButton widgets 
	  and gadgets.

	* Allowing mouse button 3 to activate a CascadeButton menu.

	* Providing three new resources{pathMode, fileFilterStyle and 
	  dirTextLabelString} for the XmFileSelectionBox widget.

	* Allowing multiple virtual key bindings.

	* Providing visual enhancements.


	Each of the preceding enchancements can be controlled by a resource:
	either a widget resource or an application-wide resource. The
	default values for this resource provide behavior and API's that are
	identical to that of OSF/Motif 1.2.4. In addition, each of the 
	enhancements has a unique "ifdef" that can be set in the 
	./lib/Xm/Imakefile.

	
XmString data size fix

	This fix (CR 10079) improves backward compatibility with applications 
	built with previous versions of the shared library.

	Add the flag -DXM_STRINGS_1_2_2_STATE to the DEFINES macro in 
	./lib/Xm/Imakefile to enable this fix.
