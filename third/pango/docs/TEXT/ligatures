PANGO_LIGATURE_HACK is defined as follows

It comprises a space-seperated list of elements. An 
element can either be of the form :xx:zzzz, in which 
case the first part is a language code and the second 
is a name of another property to look in if the
language is matched.
   
or as follows

  $AAAA=0000+007F-0915,0944

  This defines a set, this will be visible to the entire font.
    
or of the form
  
  xxxx[+xxxx[+xxxx...]]=yyyy[+yyyy]

  xxxx can either be a hex glyph code which is matches directly, 
  or %AAAA, where it will match anything in the set.

  yyyy is either a hex glyph code, or %n, in which case it refers
  to the nth thing to have matched - e.g.

  %FOO+2=2+%1,   would swap instances of $FOO and 2.



(The language-specific stuff isn't implemented yet, but is parsed OK
 and duly ignored here. This will be implemented soon)
