This is directory lrmi-0.6m from the svgalib 1.4.1 distribution, with
minor changes to the Makefile. I can't seem to be able to contact Josh
Vanderhoof, and his homepage is dead. -- John Fremlin (vii@altern.org).

From svgalib:

This is a modified version of Josh Vanderhoof's lrmi-0.5 package
The original is available at http://www.planet.net/pjoshv/



vbetest - show available modes, and test a mode

mode3 - set mode using vesa bios. It can usually restore text mode after
        svgalib leaves a non-working text-mode.

vga_reset - call real mode c000:0003, which should be the video card's
	initialization routine. Should work in some cases when mode3 fails to
	restore text mode.
