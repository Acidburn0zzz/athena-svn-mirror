Hacking on Nautilus
-------------------

The Nautilus source tree is available from GNOME cvs (cvs.gnome.org) and 
in releases on the GNOME FTP site
(http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/nautilus/).

If you plan to hack on Nautilus, please make sure you work from the
CVS version. The CVS version can be checked from the GNOME cvs server.
See http://developer.gnome.org/tools/cvs.html for details on how to get 
started with GNOME CVS.

If you want to contribute patches, please send mail to the nautilus
mailing list: <nautilus-list@gnome.org>.  Archives and subscription
information are available at
http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/nautilus-list

You can also attach patches to individual bugs in bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product 'nautilus').

Patches should be made with 'cvs diff -pu >patch' and should conform to
Nautilus coding style as described in docs/style-guide.html Please
read other relevant documents in the docs directory too.
