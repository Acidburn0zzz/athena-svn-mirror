Building Nautilus RPMs from CVS HEAD usually works, since Eazel's build
engineer tests the RPM building process regularly. We encourage people to
test out RPM builds, and report bugs about them to the Nautilus mailing list:
<nautilus-list@lists.eazel.com>.

However, we would prefer if no one distributed RPMs created from CVS versions
of the source code: Eazel will make RPMs for releases of Nautilus, so that
people can use it without going through the pain of setting up a build
system, but we'd be happier if there weren't RPMs out there for other
non-released versions.

If, despite this, you decide to distribute your own RPMs, please contact
the Nautilus maintainer, Darin Adler <darin@eazel.com>, and let him know.
