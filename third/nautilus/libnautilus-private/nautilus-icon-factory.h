/* NautilusIconFactory is a class that knows how to hand out icons to be
 * used for representing files and some other objects. It was designed
 * specifically to be useful for the Nautilus file browser, but could be
 * used by any program that wants to display the standard icon for a
 * file.
 * 
 * The most common usage is to get a NautilusIconFactory object with
 * nautilus_get_current_icon_factory, then ask for an icon for a specific
 * file with nautilus_icon_factory_get_icon_for_file. The caller can ask
 * for any size icon, but normally will use one of the defined 
 * NAUTILUS_ICON_SIZE macros.
