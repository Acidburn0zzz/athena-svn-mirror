For eazel-helper to work, it must be installed in a well-known
location, and it needs two config files to be placed in the PAM setup
directories.  You get this for free if you do 'gmake install' as root.

If you're using eazel-hacking tools (and if you're hacking on Nautilus
or Trilobite, I highly recommend them), then 'gmake install' will
install the required PAM files into /gnome/etc instead of /etc.  This
is fine.  To finish the setup, do (as root):

# ln -s /gnome/etc/pam.d/eazel-helper /etc/pam.d/eazel-helper
# ln -s /gnome/etc/security/console.apps/eazel-helper /etc/security/console.apps/eazel-helper

If you have an eazel-hacking from December 2000 or later, it should make
those links for you, for free.  I forgot to do it before them because
I'm a loser.

The whole setup requires "userhelper" to be installed in /usr/sbin.
On Redhat, this is package "usermode".  I recommend version 1.36 at
least, because the API has changed a lot.
