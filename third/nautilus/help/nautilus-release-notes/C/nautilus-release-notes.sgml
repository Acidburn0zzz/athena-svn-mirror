     <guimenuitem>music files and folders</guimenuitem> let you
     organize your MP3s into albums, attach custom icons, and more.
    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>
     Nautilus includes a fast <guimenuitem>find</guimenuitem> feature
     that indexes your hard disk so you can quickly search for a file

   <title>Upgrading From a Beta Version of Nautilus</title>

   <para>
    <guimenuitem>Restoring Custom Settings</guimenuitem>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you installed Nautilus Preview Release 1, 2, or 3, you will
    lose some of your custom settings when you upgrade to Nautilus
    1.0. One symptom of this problem is that your icons will look like
    text files and your desktop may not be correctly drawn.
   </para>

   <para>
    The preview release versions of Nautilus created XML files (links
    and metafiles containing your customization information) with
    incorrect capitalization. Because of this error, your Nautilus
    links may now appear as plain text files beginning with
    "&lt;?xml," and customizations such as custom icons, captions, and
    backgrounds may be lost.
   </para>

   <para>
    To restore a normal appearance, open a terminal window and run this
    command:
   </para>

   <para>
    nautilus-xml-migrate <emphasis>directory</emphasis>
   </para>

   <para>
    This command searches the directory you specify (or the current
    directory if you don't specify one) and all subdirectories for
    files with a first line beginning with "&lt;?xml" and a second line
    beginning with "&lt;NAUTILUS." If any such files are found, their XML
    tags will be corrected to be lower case instead of upper case.
   </para>

   <para>
    After the command has been executed, return to Nautilus and click
    the Refresh button to see the corrected window.
   </para>

   <para>
    <guimenuitem>Problems Loading Web Pages</guimenuitem>
   </para>

   <para>
    If you installed Nautilus Preview Release 1 or 2, and you are
    having problems loading Web pages, you may need to delete two
    directories. Follow these steps:
   </para>

   <para>
    1. Shut down Nautilus and the gconfd utility. To do this, open a
    terminal window and enter the following commands:
   </para>

     <simplelist>
      <member>nautilus --quit </member>
      <member>nautilus-clean.sh -x</member>
     </simplelist>

    <para>
     2. Remove the following two directories:
    </para>

     <simplelist>
      <member>~/.gconf</member>
      <member>~/.gconfd</member>
     </simplelist>

   <para>
    3. Restart Nautilus.
   </para>

   <para><guimenuitem>Medusa Off by Default</guimenuitem></para>

   <para>The Medusa daemon, which indexes your hard disk so fast
   searches can be performed, is turned off by default. To turn it on,
   follow these steps:
   </para>

   <para>
    1. Open the preferences menu and choose Preferences.
   </para>

   <para>
    2. Click Search in the left-hand column of the Preferences dialog box.
   </para>

   <para>
    3. In the Fast Search section, make sure that the button next to
    Enable fast search is turned on.
   </para>

   <para>
    4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
   </para>

   <para>Note: For Medusa to perform its indexing task, the crond
   program must also be running. If you have turned off crond, Medusa
   won't work.
   </para>
