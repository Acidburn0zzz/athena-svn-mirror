1) PROBLEM WITH RPM POST-INSTALL SCRIPTS FOR SCROLLKEEPER < 0.3.3
Note that RPM's from 0.2 to 0.3.1 shipped with a post-install script to remove
the ScrollKeeper database when ScrollKeeper is uninstalled.  However, due to
the order in which RPM executes its scripts, the database is removed after the
new database is built.  Thus, the user is left without a database.  This 
problem is fixed starting with ScrollKeeper 0.3.3.  However, any upgrade where
the old RPM has version 0.2 to 0.3.1 will exhibit this problem.  One solution
is to execute "scrollkeeper-rebuilddb" after the upgrade is finished.
