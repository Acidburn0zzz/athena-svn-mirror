>      Like IMAP and LDAP data, information for
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Exchange</SPAN
>accounts is stored on the
      server, not on your desktop computer.  This means that you can
      access it from multiple locations. It also means that your
      Microsoft <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Exchange</SPAN
>account information
      is in a seperate folder tree from the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Local</SPAN
>
      tree in your folder bar. You'll see it below the local tree,
      with the name you gave the account. If you have multiple
      accounts, you will have multiple folder trees.
    </P

>      Click on any of the folder tree items to visit them; you may
      have to enter your server password.  You can now create contact
      cards, send and receive email as you would normally. If there
      are items in your local calendar or addressbook that you'd like
      to add to your <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Exchange</SPAN
>stores, you
      can copy and paste them over, or just drag items from one folder
      to another as you would with two local stores.

>Saving Attached Addresses and Appointments: </B
>          If you are using both an Exchange account and a local mail
          account, you should be aware that whenever you save an email
          address or appointment from an email message, it will be
          saved in your Exchange contacts list or calendar, rather
          than in your local account. The same is true of
          synchronization with Palm-OS devices: tasks, appointments,
          and addresses from your Palm-OS device will be synchronized
          with those in the Exchange folders rather than local
          folders.

>The Global Address List Is Empty At First: </B
>          To avoid unnecessary strain on the server, the GAL will
          appear empty until you have searched for something in it.
          If you want to display all the cards in the list, click in
          the search box and press <B
CLASS="KEYCAP"
>Enter</B
>.  This
          enters a blank search: since every card contains a blank in
          it, every card will appear.
