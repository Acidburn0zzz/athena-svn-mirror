>       Organizing your address book is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the address book does not allow Virtual Folders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  To
       learn about categories, read <A
HREF="usage-contact-organize.html#USAGE-CONTACT-ORGANIZE-GROUP-CATEGORY"
>the section called <I
>Grouping with Categories</I
></A
>.

>         <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
> offers two ways for you
         to organize your cards.  The first way is to use folders;
         this works the same way mail folders do.  For more
         flexibility, you can also mark contacts as elements of
         different categories.  To better integrate with email tools,
         you can also create lists of contacts that you can send mail
         to as a single person.

><P
>	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Contacts</SPAN
> folder.  If you've read <A
HREF="usage-mainwindow.html"
>Chapter 1</A
> then you already know that you
	   can create a new folder by selecting 
           <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>New</SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Folder</SPAN
>
           and that you can put new folders anywhere you like. Just
	   like with mail, cards must be in a card folder, and no card
	   can be in two places at once.  If you want more
	   flexibility, try <A
HREF="usage-contact-organize.html#USAGE-CONTACT-ORGANIZE-GROUP-CATEGORY"
>the section called <I
>Grouping with Categories</I
></A
>.
	 </P
><P
>          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view.  Remember that contact cards can only go in
          contact folders, just like mail can only go in mail folders,
          and calendars in calendar folders.

NAME="USAGE-CONTACT-ORGANIZE-GROUP-CATEGORY"
>Grouping with Categories</A
></H3
><P
>           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  
           That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.  
        </P
><P
>           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Categories</SPAN
> button at the lower
           right.  From the dialog box that appears, you can check as
           many or as few categories as you like.

               </P
></LI
><LI
><P

              </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                Enter names or email addresses of contacts, or just
	        drag contacts from the main window into the list.
              </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>                 Choose whether you would like to hide the email
                 addresses when you send a message to the list.
                 Unless it is a very small list, it is recommended
                 that you leave the addresses hidden.  This is the
                 same thing as using the "Bcc:" feature discussed in
                 <A
HREF="usage-mail-getnsend-send.html#USAGE-MAIL-GETNSEND-SEND-TO-TYPES"
>the section called <I
>Specifying Recipients for Email</I
> in Chapter 3</A
>.
              </P
></LI
></OL
>
        </P
><P
>           When you are done, click <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>OK</SPAN
>. The
           list will appear as a contact card, which you can use as
           you would any other. That includes emailing the list to
           another person, and, of course, sending email to the list.
        </P
><P
>           To mail the list, open a new email and type the name you
           chose for the list. Ximian Evolution will address the
           message to the entire list when you send it. You can also
           right-click on the list's address card in the Contact
           Manager and select <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Send Message to
           List</SPAN
>.
