             else actually helps to generate better keys, because it

>Why Use a Keyserver?: </B

	    friends can decrypt your messages.  If you choose not to
	    use a keyserver, you can manually send your people public
	    key, include it in your signature file, or put it on your
	    own web page. However, it's easier to publish them once,
	    and then let people download them from the keyserver when
	    they want.
