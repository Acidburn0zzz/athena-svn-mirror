>      Once you have installed the Connector, you need to set up access
      for your <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Exchange</SPAN
> account on both the
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Exchange</SPAN
> server and within
      Evolution. If you are not sure of the information you need to
      set up your Exchange account, ask your system administrator, or
      use the Ximian Connector Tester utility, which is installed
      alongside the Ximian Connector.  To start it, select
      <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>         Programs
       </SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>         Internet
      </SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>         Ximian Connector Tester</SPAN
> or run the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>connect-test</B
> in a
terminal window. The utility will help you determine if your Exchange
server is compatible with the Ximian Connector, and locate your Active
Directory server. Armed with that information, you'll be ready to set
up a new account on your Exchange server and get to work.
