        important differences.  First, it's built to handle very large
        amounts of mail.  Both the <A

>filtering</A
> and
        <A
HREF="usage-mail-organize-search.html"
>searching</A
>
        functions were built for speed and efficiency on large volumes
        of mail. There's also the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ximian Evolution</SPAN
>
        <A
HREF="usage-mail-organize-vfolders.html"
>vFolder</A
>,
        an advanced organizational feature not found in mainstream
        mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep every
        message you get in case you need to refer to it later, you'll
        find this feature especially useful.

> Just like with folders, you can right-click on messages in the
        message list and get a menu of possible actions: you can move,
        delete, or undelete them, and create filters or vFolders based
        on them.

><P
>        Most of the mail-related actions you'll want to perform are
        listed in the <SPAN

        The most frequently used ones, like
        <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Reply</SPAN
> and
        <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Forward</SPAN
>, also appear as buttons in
        the toolbar. Almost all of them are also located in the
        right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
        faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose
        whichever way you like best; the idea is that the software
        should work the way you want, rather than making you work the
        way the it does.
