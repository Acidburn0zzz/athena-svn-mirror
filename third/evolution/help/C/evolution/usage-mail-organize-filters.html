>	Filters work very much like the mail room in a large company.
	Their purpose is to bundle, sort, and distribute mail to the
	various folders.  In addition, you can have multiple filters
	performing multiple actions that may effect the same message
	in several ways.  For example, your filters could put copies
	of one message into multiple folders, or keep a copy and send
	one to another person as well, and it can do that quickly. Of
	course, it's also faster and more flexible than an actual
	person with a pile of envelopes.

>Rule name</SPAN

	      For each filter criterion, you must first select 
	      which of the following parts of the message you want the filter to 
	      examine:
	      
	      <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>		    Sender - The sender's address.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Recipients - The recipients of the message.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Subject - The subject line of the message.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Specific Header - The filter can look at any header you
		    want, even obscure or custom ones. Enter the header name
		    in the first text box, and put your search text in the
		    second one.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Message Body - Search in the actual text of the message.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Expression - For programmers only: match a message according to an
		    expression you write in the Scheme language, used to
		    define filters in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Ximian Evolution</SPAN
>.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Date sent - Filter messages according to the date on
		    which they were sent: First, choose the conditions you
		    want a message to meet &#8212; <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>before</SPAN
>
		    a given time, <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>after</SPAN
> it, and so forth.
		    Then, choose the time. The filter will compare the
		    message's time-stamp to the system clock when the filter
		    is run, or to a specific time and date you choose from a
		    calendar.  You can even have it look for messages within a
		    range of time relative to the filter &#8212; perhaps you're
		    looking for messages less than two days old.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Date Received - This works the same way as the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Date Sent</SPAN

		    option, except that it compares the time you got the message 
		    with the dates you specify.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Score - Emails have a standard priority range from -3 (least
		    important) to 3 (most important). You can have filters set the
		    priority of messages you receive, and then have other filters 
		    applied only to those messages which have a certain priority.

></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Size (kb) - Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes.

>           If you store your mail on the mail server and check your
           mail with IMAP, filters are applied to the INBOX when you
           open it. In some cases, you will see a number of unread
           messages in the INBOX, click the INBOX, and then have the
           messages move elsewhere as they are filtered out.
