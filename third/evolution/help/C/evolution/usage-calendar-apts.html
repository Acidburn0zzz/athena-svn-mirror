        starting and ending times or to mark it as an <SPAN

>All
        day event</SPAN

CLASS="GUILABEL"
>All day event</SPAN
>
        appears at the top of a day's appointment list, in the grey header under the date, rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day appointment, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        appointments.  Of course, appointments with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.
