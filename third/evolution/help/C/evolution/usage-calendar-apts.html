CLASS="GUILABEL"
>All day event</SPAN

        appears at the top of a day's appointment list, in the grey header under the date, rather than inside
        it.  That makes it easy to have appointments that overlap and fit
        inside each other.  For example, a conference might be an all
        day appointment, and the meetings at the conference would be timed
        appointments.  Of course, appointments with specific starting and ending
        times can also overlap.  When they do they're displayed as
        multiple columns in the day view of the calendar.

      </P

>	You can also configure timezone information specific to the
	Start and End time in each appointment.  To do that, simply
	create a new appointment and click on a globe to customize the
	timezone that the time exists in. For example, if you live in
	New York but have a telephone meeting set for noon with
	someone in California, you need to make sure that you're not
	calling each other a few hours off.  Setting time-zones on a
	per-appointment basis helps avoid that potential confusion.
