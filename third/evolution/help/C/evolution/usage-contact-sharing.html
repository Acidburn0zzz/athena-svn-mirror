       them, browse other peoples addressbooks, or maintain a shared set of
       contact information for your company or your department.  This
       is the sort of feature you'll want to use if your company has a
       list of vendors and clients that needs constant updating.  If
       you share calendars as well as addressbooks, people can avoid
       duplicating work and keep up to date on developments within
       their workgroup or across the entire company.

>	    Ray wants to schedule a meeting with Company X, so he
	    checks the network for the Company X address card so he
	    knows whom to call there.  Since his company also shares
	    calendars, he then learns that his co-worker Deanna has
	    already scheduled a meeting with Company X next Thursday.
	    He can either go to the meeting himself or ask Deanna to
	    discuss his concerns for him.  Either way, he avoids
	    scheduling an extra meeting with Company X.

>       Of course, you don't want to share all of your cards&#8212; why
       overload the network with a list of babysitters or tell
       everyone in the office you're talking to new job prospects?  If
       you keep cards on your own computer, you can decide which items
       you want to make accessible to others.

       contact folders, see <A

       Once you have a connection, the network contacts folder or
       folders will appear inside the <TT

       Directories</B

> folder in the folder bar.  It will work
       exactly like a local folder of cards, with the following
       exceptions:

>              Network folders are only available when you are
              connected to the network.  If you use a laptop or have a
              modem connection, you may wish to copy or cache the
              network directory.  You do this by dragging and dropping your desired contacts into the local contacts list.
