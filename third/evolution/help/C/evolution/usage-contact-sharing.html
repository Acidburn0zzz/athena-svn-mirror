>      The <A

> protocol was
      created to let users share contact information over a network.
      LDAP allows for users to browse other people's addressbooks, or
      maintain a shared set of contact information for a company or
      department.  This feature comes in handy if you are in a group
      where there are lots of people using the same contacts.  Such an
      example would be the sales department of a company with their
      client list.

>	    Rich wants to schedule a meeting with Company X, so he
	    checks the network for the Company X address card so he
	    knows whom to call there.  Since his company also shares
	    calendars, he then learns that his co-worker Deanna has
	    already scheduled a meeting with Company X next Thursday.
	    He can either go to the meeting himself or ask Deanna to
	    discuss his concerns for him.  Either way, he avoids
	    scheduling an extra meeting with Company X.

>       Of course, you don't want to share all of your cards&#8212; why
       overload the network with a list of babysitters or tell
       everyone in the office you're talking to new job prospects?  If
       you keep cards on your own computer, you can decide which items
       you want to make accessible to others.

       Once you have a LDAP connection, the network contacts folder or
       folders will appear inside the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>External
       Directories</SPAN
> folder in the folder bar.  It will work
       exactly like a local folder of cards, with the following
       exceptions:

>              Network folders are only available when you are
              connected to the network.  If you use a laptop or have a
              modem connection, you may wish to copy or cache the
              network directory.  You do this by dragging and dropping
              your desired contacts into the local contacts list.
