>       Organizing your address book is a lot like organizing your
       mail.  You can have folders and searches the same way you can
       with mail, but the address book does not allow Virtual Folders.  It
       does, however, allow each card to fall under several
       categories, and allow you to create your own categories.  To
       learn about categories, read <A
HREF="usage-contact-organize.html#USAGE-CONTACT-ORGANIZE-GROUP-CATEGORY"
>the section called <I
>Grouping with Categories</I
></A
>.

> offers two ways for you
         to organize your cards.  The first way is to use folders;
         this works the same way mail folders do.  For more
         flexibility, you can also mark contacts as elements of
         different categories.

>	   The simplest way to group address cards is to use folders.
	   By default, cards start in the
	   <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>Contacts</SPAN
> folder.  If you've read <A
HREF="usage-mainwindow.html"
>Chapter 1</A
> then you already know that you
	   can create a new folder by selecting 
           <SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENU"
>File</SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUISUBMENU"
>New</SPAN
>-&gt;<SPAN
CLASS="GUIMENUITEM"
>Folder</SPAN
>
           and that you can put new folders anywhere you like. Just
	   like with mail, cards must be in a card folder, and no card
	   can be in two places at once.  If you want more
	   flexibility, try <A
HREF="usage-contact-organize.html#USAGE-CONTACT-ORGANIZE-GROUP-CATEGORY"
>the section called <I
>Grouping with Categories</I
></A
>.
	 </P
><P
>          To put a card into a folder, just drag it there from the
          folder view.  Remember that contact cards can only go in
          contact folders, just like mail can only go in mail folders,
          and calendars in calendar folders.

><P
>           The other way to group cards is to mark them as belonging
           to different categories.  
           That means that you
           can mark a card as being in several categories or no
           category at all.  For example, I put my friend Matthew's
           card in the "Business" category, because he works with me,
           the "Friends" category, because he's also my friend, and
           the "Frequent" category, because I call him all the time
           and can never remember his phone number.  
        </P
><P
>           To mark a card as belonging to a category, click the
           <SPAN
CLASS="GUIBUTTON"
>Categories</SPAN
> button at the lower
           right.  From the dialog box that appears, you can check as
           many or as few categories as you like.
        </P

>           Then, you can refer to all the cards in that category by:
            Waiting for Evolution to support the
           operation.
