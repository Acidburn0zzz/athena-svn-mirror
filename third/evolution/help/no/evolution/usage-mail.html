CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN

      differences.  First, it's built to handle very large amounts of
      mail without slowing down or crashing.  Both the <A
HREF="usage-mail-organize-filters.html"
>filtering</A
> and <A
HREF="usage-mail-organize-search.html"
>searching</A
> functions
      were built for speed and efficiency on gargantuan volumes of
      mail. There's also the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
>
      <A
HREF="usage-mail-organize-vfolders.html"
>Virtual
      Folder</A
>, an advanced organizational feature not found in
      mainstream mail clients.  If you get a lot of mail, or if you keep
      every message you get in case you need to refer to it later,
      you'll find this feature especially useful.

        folders, you can right-click on messages in the message list and
        get a menu of possible actions.

      right-click menu and as keyboard shortcuts, which tend to be
      faster once you get the hang of them.  You can choose whichever
      way you like best; the idea is that the software should work the
      way you want, rather than making you work the way the it does.
