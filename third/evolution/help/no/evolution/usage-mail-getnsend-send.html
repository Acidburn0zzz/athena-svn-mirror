          The email <SPAN

          works in much the same way.  It's particularly useful if you
          have received a message and you think someone else would

          to a new message (this is the default) or

          portion of the message you are sending.  Attachment
          forwarding is best if you want to send the full, unaltered
          message on to someone else.  Inline forwarding is best if
          you want to send portions of a message, or if you have a
          large number of comments on different sections of the
          message you are forwarding.  Remember to note from whom the
          message came, and where, if at all, you have removed or
          altered content.
