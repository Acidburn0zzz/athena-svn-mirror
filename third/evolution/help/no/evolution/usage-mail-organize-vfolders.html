>	If filters aren't flexible enough for you, or you find
	yourself performing the same search again and again, consider
	a virtual folder. Virtual folders, or vFolders, are an
	advanced way of viewing your email messages within
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
>.  If you get a lot of
	mail or often forget where you put messages, virtual folders can help
	you stay on top of things.
      </P
><P
>	A virtual folder is really a hybrid of all the other organizational
	tools: it looks like a folder, it acts like a search, and you
	set it up like a filter.  In other words, while a conventional
	folder actually contains messages, a virtual folder is a view of
	messages that may be in several different folders.  The
	messages it contains are determined on the fly using a set of
	criteria you choose in advance.
      </P
><P
>	As messages that meet the virtual folder criteria arrive or are
	deleted, <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
> will
	automatically place them in and remove them from the
	virtual folder contents list.  When you delete a message, it gets
	erased from the folder in which it actually exists, as well as
	any virtual folders which display it.
      </P
><P
>	Imagine a business trying to keep track of mail from hundreds
	of vendors and clients, or a university with overlapping and
	changing groups of faculty, staff, administrators and
	students.  The more mail you need to organize, the less you
	can afford the sort of confusion that stems from an
	organizational system that's not flexible enough.  Virtual folders
	make for better organization because they can accept
	overlapping groups in a way that regular folders and filing
	systems can't.

>	To organize his mailbox, Jim sets up a virtual volder for emails from
	his friend and co-worker Anna.  He has another one for messages that
	have ximian.com in the address and <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
> in the subject line, so he
	can keep a record of what people from work send him about
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>evolution</SPAN
>.  If Anna sends him a message about
	anything other than <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
>, it only shows up in the "Anna" folder.
	When Anna sends him mail about the user interface for
	<SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>evolution</SPAN
>, he can see that message both in
	the "Anna" virtual folder and in the "Internal Evolution Discussion"
	virtual folder.

></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>		    Sender - The sender's address.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Recipients - The recipients of the message.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Subject - The subject line of the message.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Specific Header - The virtual folder can look at any header you
		    want, even obscure or custom ones. Enter the header name
		    in the first text box, and put your search text in the
		    second one.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Message Body - Search in the actual text of the message.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Expression - For programmers only: match a message according to an
		    expression you write in the Scheme language, used to
		    define virtual folders in <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
>.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
> Date sent - Search messages according to the date on
		    which they were sent: First, choose the conditions you
		    want a message to meet &#8212; <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>before</SPAN
>
		    a given time, <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"
>after</SPAN
> it, and so forth.
		    Then, choose the time. The virtual folder will compare the
		    message's time-stamp to the system clock when the filter
		    is run, or to a specific time and date you choose from a
		    calendar.  You can even have it look for messages within a
		    range of time relative to the filter &#8212; perhaps you're
		    looking for messages less than two days old.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Date Recieved - This works the same way as the <SPAN
CLASS="GUILABEL"

		    option, except that it compares the time you got the message 
		    with the dates you specify.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Score - Emails have a standard priority range from -3 (least
		    important) to 3 (most important). You can have virtual folders set the
		    priority of messages you recieve, and then have other
		    virtual folders 
		    applied only to those messages which have a certain priority.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>		    Size (kb) - Sorts based on the size of the message in kilobytes.

		    attachment in the email.
