             and intuitive interface that users can customize to their
             liking, and users should have access to shortcuts for
             complex tasks.

><P
>              <SPAN

              exceed the standards set by other groupware products.
              It must include support for major network <A
HREF="apx-gloss.html#PROTOCOL"
><I
CLASS="GLOSSTERM"
>protocols</I
></A
> so that it can
              integrate seamlessly with existing hardware and network
              environments.
            </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>               The project must support open standards and be open to
               expansion, so that it can become a development platform
               as well as an application.  From the simplest scripting
               to the most complex network and component programming,
               <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>Evolution</SPAN
> must offer
               developers an environment for cutting-edge application
               development.

      daily tasks faster.  For example, it takes only one or two
      clicks to enter an appointment or an address card sent to you
      by email, or to send email to a contact or appointment.
      <SPAN

>Evolution</SPAN

      more efficient, so searches are faster and memory usage is
      lower.  People who get lots of mail will appreciate advanced
      features like <A

      they were ordinary mail folders.
