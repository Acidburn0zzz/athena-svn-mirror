This directory contains fonts pulled from Red Hat, so that we may use
them on Solaris to give users a consistent fontconfig experience.

We used to maintain this directory by preparing a tarfile with a flat
namespace on a Red Hat machine and then importing it, but that scheme
collapsed when Red Hat introduced multiple fonts with the same
filename.  So now we prepare a tarfile on a Red Hat machine and just
check it in.

To prepare the tarfile, first look at /etc/fonts/fonts.conf.  Near the
top, it should say something like:

  <dir>/usr/share/fonts</dir>
  <dir>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1</dir>
  <dir>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/OTF</dir>
  <dir>~/.fonts</dir>

These tell us the directories we need to tar up.  We can non-system
directories like ~/.fonts as well as any empty directories.  Now
prepare the tarfile like so:

  cd /tmp
  mkdir rhfonts
  cd rhfonts
  cp -r /usr/share/fonts usr-share-fonts
  cp -r /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 usr-X11R6-lib-X11-fonts-Type1
  cp -r /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/OTF usr-X11R6-lib-X11-fonts-OTF
  rm -rf usr-share-fonts/zh_CN
  rm -rf usr-share-fonts/monotype
  find . -name "fonts.cache-*" | xargs rm
  pax -x ustar -w * | gzip -c > ../redhat-fonts-el4.tar.gz

(Using "tar" on Linux with long pathnames can result in a tarfile
which can't be extracted on Solaris, so we use pax instead.  The
removed font directories have licenses which do not allow
redistribution outside of Red Hat.)

Replace the Red Hat version and the font directories as appropriate.

Check in the new tarfile (add it with "cvs add -kb" so it's treated as
a binary file) and cvs remove the old tarfile.  Adjust Makefile.athena
for the new filename.
