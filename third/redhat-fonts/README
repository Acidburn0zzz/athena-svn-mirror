This directory contains fonts pulled from Red Hat, so that we may use
them on Solaris to give users a consistent fontconfig experience.

We maintain this directory by preparing a tarfile on a Red Hat machine
and then importing it.  To prepare the tarfile, first look at
/etc/fonts/fonts.conf; near the top, it should say something like:

	<dir>/usr/share/fonts</dir>
	<dir>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1</dir>
	<dir>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/OTF</dir>
	<dir>~/.fonts</dir>

These tell us the directories we need to tar up.  ~/.fonts is not a
system font directory, of course, and /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/OTF
happens to be empty, so for Red Hat 9 we only care about the first
two.  Now prepare the tarfile like so:

  cd /tmp
  mkdir redhat-fonts-9
  cd redhat-fonts-9
  find /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/Type1 /usr/share/fonts \
    \( -name "*.pcf" -o -name "*.pf[ab]" \) -exec cp {} . \;
  cd ..
  tar czf redhat-fonts-9.tar.gz redhat-fonts-9

Replace the Red Hat version and the directory list as appropriate, and
be on the alert for new types of font files as well.  Note that
currently we are not including True Type ("*.ttf") font files, due
to licensing issues with some of them.

Then use the import script to import the tarfile as documented in
/mit/source/doc/procedures.  The command will look something like:

  $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/import.sh /tmp/redhat-fonts-9.tar.gz OLDVERS

where OLDVERS is the last Red Hat version this was done for.

If new types of font files have been added, edit Makefile.athena
accordingly.
