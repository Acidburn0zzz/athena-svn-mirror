/*
 * The handle table is a hierarchical tree designed for quick mapping
 * of handle identifiers to objects.  Objects contain their own handle
 * identifiers if they have them, so the reverse mapping is also
 * quick.  The hierarchy is made up of table objects, each of which
 * has 120 entries, a flag indicating whether the table is a leaf
 * table or an indirect table, the handle of the first object covered
 * by the table and the first object after that that's *not* covered
 * by the table, a count of how many objects of either type are
 * currently stored in the table, and an array of 120 entries pointing
 * either to objects or tables.
 *
 * When we go to add an object to the table, we look to see if the
 * next object handle to be assigned is covered by the outermost
 * table.  If it is, we find the place within that table where the
 * next handle should go, and if necessary create additional nodes in
 * the tree to contain the new handle.  The pointer to the object is
 * then stored in the correct position.
 *
 * XXXTL
 * Theoretically, we could have some code here to free up handle
 * tables as they go out of use, but by and large handle tables won't
 * go out of use, so this is being skipped for now.  It shouldn't be
 * too hard to implement in the future if there's a different
 * application.
