></H2
><P
>The data stored in the DNS is identified by <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain
names</I
> that are organized as a tree according to
organizational or administrative boundaries. Each node of the tree,
called a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
>, is given a label. The domain name of the
node is the concatenation of all the labels on the path from the
node to the <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>root</I
> node.  This is represented
in written form as a string of labels listed from right to left and
separated by dots. A label need only be unique within its parent
domain.</P
><P
>For example, a domain name for a host at the
company <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>Example, Inc.</I
> could be
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>mail.example.com</TT
>,
where <TT
CLASS="literal"
>com</TT
> is the
top level domain to which
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>ourhost.example.com</TT

<TT
CLASS="literal"
>example</TT
> is
a subdomain of <TT
CLASS="literal"
>com</TT
>, and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>ourhost</TT
> is the
name of the host.</P
><P
>For administrative purposes, the name space is partitioned into
areas called <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>zones</I
>, each starting at a node and
extending down to the leaf nodes or to nodes where other zones start.
The data for each zone is stored in a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>name
server</I
>, which answers queries about the zone using the
<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>DNS protocol</I
>.
</P
><P
>The data associated with each domain name is stored in the
form of <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>resource records</I
> (<SPAN
CLASS="acronym"

Some of the supported resource record types are described in
<A

><P
>To properly operate a name server, it is important to understand
the difference between a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>zone</I
>
and a <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
>.</P
><P
>As we stated previously, a zone is a point of delegation in
the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> tree. A zone consists of
those contiguous parts of the domain
tree for which a a name server has complete information and over which
it has authority. It contains all domain names from a certain point
downward in the domain tree except those which are delegated to
other zones. A delegation point is marked by one or more
<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>NS records</I
> in the
parent zone, which should be matched by equivalent NS records at
the root of the delegated zone.</P
><P
>For instance, consider the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>example.com</TT
>
domain which includes names
such as <TT
CLASS="literal"
>host.aaa.example.com</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>host.bbb.example.com</TT
> even though
the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>example.com</TT
> zone includes
only delegations for the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>aaa.example.com</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>bbb.example.com</TT
> zones.  A zone can map
exactly to a single domain, but could also include only part of a
domain, the rest of which could be delegated to other
name servers. Every name in the <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>DNS</SPAN
> tree is a
<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
>, even if it is
<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>terminal</I
>, that is, has no
<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>subdomains</I
>.  Every subdomain is a domain and
every domain except the root is also a subdomain. The terminology is
not intuitive and we suggest that you read RFCs 1033, 1034 and 1035 to
gain a complete understanding of this difficult and subtle
topic.</P
><P
>Though <SPAN
CLASS="acronym"
>BIND</SPAN
> is called a "domain name server",
it deals primarily in terms of zones. The master and slave
declarations in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>named.conf</TT
> file specify
zones, not domains. When you ask some other site if it is willing to
be a slave server for your <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>domain</I
>, you are
actually asking for slave service for some collection of zones.</P

To make the DNS tolerant of server and network failures,
most zones have two or more authoritative servers.

The authoritative servers are also listed in the zone file itself,
at the <I

list servers in the parent's delegation that are not present at
the zone's top level.</P

>A <I

authoritative for a zone but is not listed in that zone's NS

zone to speed up access to the zone's records or to make sure that the
zone is available even if all the "official" servers for the zone are
inaccessible.</P
><P
>A configuration where the primary master server itself is a
stealth server is often referred to as a "hidden primary"
configuration.  One use for this configuration is when the primary master
is behind a firewall and therefore unable to communicate directly

directly to the authoritative servers.  Instead, they rely on a local
name server to perform the resolution on their behalf.  Such a server

<I

>There may be one or more forwarders,
and they are queried in turn until the list is exhausted or an answer

wish all the servers at a given site to interact directly with the rest of
the Internet servers. A typical scenario would involve a number
of internal <SPAN

to pass packets through the firewall would forward to the server
that can do it, and that server would query the Internet <SPAN

on the internal server's behalf. An added benefit of using the forwarding
feature is that the central machine develops a much more complete
cache of information that all the clients can take advantage

A server that is not authoritative for any zones and only provides
