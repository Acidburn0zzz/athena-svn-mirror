.Nd lightweight resolver socket address structure to hostname and service name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <lwres/netdb.h>
.Fd
.Ft int
.Fo lwres_getnameinfo
.Fa "const struct sockaddr *sa"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
This function is equivalent to the
.Xr getnameinfo 3
function defined in RFC2133.
.Fn lwres_getnameinfo
returns the hostname for the
.Dv "struct sockaddr"
.Fa sa
which is
.Fa salen
bytes long.
The hostname is of length
.Fa hostlen
and is returned via
.Fa *host.
The maximum length of the hostname is
1025 bytes:
.Li NI_MAXHOST .
.Pp
The name of the service associated with the port number in
.Fa sa
is returned in
.Fa *serv.
It is
.Fa servlen
bytes long.
The maximum length of the service name is
.Li NI_MAXSERV
- 32 bytes.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
argument sets the following bits:
.Bl -tag -width NI_NUMERICSERV
.It Li NI_NOFQDN
A fully qualified domain name is not required for local hosts.
The local part of the fully qualified domain name is returned instead.
.It Li NI_NUMERICHOST
Return the address in numeric form, as if calling inet_ntop(),
instead of a host name.
.It Li NI_NAMEREQD
A name is required. If the hostname cannot be found in the DNS and
this flag is set, a non-zero error code is returned.
If the hostname is not found and the flag is not set, the 
address is returned in numeric form.
.It Li NI_NUMERICSERV
The service name is returned as a digit string representing the port number.
.It Li NI_DGRAM
Specifies that the service being looked up is a datagram
service,  and causes getservbyport() to be called with a second
argument of "udp" instead of its default of "tcp".  This is required
for the few ports (512-514) that have different services for UDP and
TCP.

.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn lwres_getnameinfo
returns 0 on success or a non-zero error code if an error occurs.
.\"
.\"	The error codes below were invented by the ISC/Nominum. They
.\"	should be defined in RFC2133 before getting documented here.
.\"	XXXJR 28/6/00
.\" The error codes are:
.\" Bl -tag -width ENI_NOSERVNAME
.\" It Li ENI_NOSOCKET
.\" there was no socket in
.\" Fa sa
.\" It Li ENI_NOSERVNAME
.\" no service name was found
.\" It Li ENI_NOHOSTNAME
.\" no hostname was found
.\" It Li ENI_MEMORY
.\" memory could not be allocated
.\" It Li ENI_SYSTEM
.\" a system error occurred
.\" It Li ENI_FAMILY
.\" an unsupported protocol family was requested
.\" It Li ENI_SALEN
.\" Fa salen

.Xr getnameinfo 3 
are.
