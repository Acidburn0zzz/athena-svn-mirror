.Sh NAME
.Nm lwres_net_ntop
.Nd lightweight resolver IP address presentation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <lwres/net.h>
.Fd
.Ft const char *
.Fo lwres_net_ntop
.Fa "int af"
.Fa "const void *src"
.Fa "char *dst"
.Fa "size_t size"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn lwres_net_ntop
converts an IP address of protocol family
.Fa af
- IPv4 or IPv6 - at location
.Fa src
from network format to its conventional representation as a string.
For IPv4 addresses, that string would be a dotted-decimal.
An IPv6 address would be represented in colon notation as described in
RFC1884.
.Pp
The generated string is copied to
.Fa dst
provided
.Fa size
indicates it is long enough to store the ASCII representation
of the address.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Pp
If successful, the function returns
.Fa dst :
a pointer to a string containing
the presentation format of the address.
.Fn lwres_net_ntop
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets the global variable
.Li errno
to
.Er EAFNOSUPPORT
if the protocol family given in
.Fa af
is not supported.
