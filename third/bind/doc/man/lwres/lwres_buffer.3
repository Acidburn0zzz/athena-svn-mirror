.Sh DESCRIPTION


These functions provide bounds checked access to a region of memory
where data is being read or written.
They are based on, and similar to, the
.Va isc_buffer_
functions in the ISC library.
.Pp
A buffer is a region of memory, together with a set of related
subregions.
The \*qused region\*q and the \*qavailable\*q region are disjoint, and
their union is the buffer's region.
The used region extends from the beginning of the buffer region to the
last used byte.
The available region extends from one byte greater than the last used
byte to the end of the  buffer's region.
The size of the used region can be changed using various
buffer commands.
Initially, the used region is empty.
.Pp
The used region is further subdivided into two disjoint regions: the
\*qconsumed region\*q and the \*qremaining region\*q.
The union of these two regions is the used region.
The consumed region extends from the beginning of the used region to
the byte before the \*qcurrent\*q offset (if any).
The \*qremaining\*q region the current pointer to the end of the used
region.
The size of the consumed region can be changed using various
buffer commands.
Initially, the consumed region is empty.
.Pp
The \*qactive region\*q is an (optional) subregion of the remaining
region.
It extends from the current offset to an offset in the
remaining region.
Initially, the active region is empty.
If the current offset advances beyond the chosen offset,
the active region will also be empty.

.Ed
.Pp
.Fn lwres_buffer_init
initializes the
.Dv lwres_buffer_t
.Fa *b
and assocates it with the memory region of size
.Fa length
bytes starting at location
.Fa base.
.Pp
.Fn lwres_buffer_invalidate
marks the buffer
.Fa *b 
as invalid.  Invalidating a buffer after use is not required,
but makes it possible to catch its possible accidental use.
.Pp
The functions
.Fn lwres_buffer_add
and
.Fn lwres_buffer_subtract
respectively increase and decrease the used space in
buffer
.Fa *b
by
.Fa n
bytes.
.Fn lwres_buffer_add
checks for buffer overflow and
.Fn lwres_buffer_subtract
checks for underflow.
These functions do not allocate or deallocate memory.
They just change the value of
.Li used .
.Pp
A buffer is re-initialised by
.Fn lwres_buffer_clear .
The function sets
.Li used ,
.Li current
and
.Li active
to zero.
.Pp
.Fn lwres_buffer_first
makes the consumed region of buffer
.Fa *p
empty by setting
.Li current
to zero (the start of the buffer).
.Pp
.Fn lwres_buffer_forward 
increases the consumed region of buffer
.Fa *b
by
.Fa n
bytes, checking for overflow.
Similarly,
.Fn lwres_buffer_back
decreases buffer
.Fa b 's
consumed region by
.Fa n
bytes and checks for underflow.
.Pp
.Fn lwres_buffer_getuint8
reads an unsigned 8-bit integer from
.Fa *b
and returns it.
.Fn lwres_buffer_putuint8
writes the unsigned 8-bit integer
.Fa val
to buffer
.Fa *b .
.Pp
.Fn lwres_buffer_getuint16
and
.Fn lwres_buffer_getuint32
are identical to
.Fn lwres_buffer_putuint8
except that they respectively read an unsigned 16-bit or 32-bit integer 
in network byte order from
.Fa b .
Similarly,
.Fn lwres_buffer_putuint16
and
.Fn lwres_buffer_putuint32
writes the unsigned 16-bit or 32-bit integer
.Fa val
to buffer
.Fa b ,
in network byte order.
.Pp
Arbitrary amounts of data are read or written from a lightweight
resolver buffer with
.Fn lwres_buffer_getmem
and
.Fn lwres_buffer_putmem
respectively.
.Fn lwres_buffer_putmem
copies
.Fa length
bytes of memory at
.Fa base
to
.Fa b.
Conversely,
.Fn lwres_buffer_getmem
copies
.Fa length
bytes of memory from
.Fa b
to
.Fa base .
