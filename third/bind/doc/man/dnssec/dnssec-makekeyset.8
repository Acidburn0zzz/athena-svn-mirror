.Op Fl t Ar TTL
.Op Fl r Ar randomdev

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
generates a key set from one or more keys created by
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 .
It creates a file containing KEY and SIG records for some zone which
can then be signed by the zone's parent if the parent zone is
DNSSEC-aware.
.Ar keyfile
should be a key identification string as reported by
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 :
i.e.
.Ar Knnnn.+aaa+iiiii
where
.Ar nnnn
is the name of the key,
.Ar aaa
is the encryption algorithm and
.Ar iiiii
is the key identifier.
Multiple
.Ar keyfile
arguments can be supplied when there are several keys to be combined
by
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
into a key set.
.Pp
For any SIG records that are in the key set, the start time when the
SIG records become valid is specified with the
.Fl s
option.
.Ar start-time
can either be an absolute or relative date.
An absolute start time is indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
notation: 20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000.
A relative start time is supplied when
.Ar start-time
is given as +N: N seconds from the current time.
If no
.Fl s
option is supplied, the current date and time is used for the start
time of the SIG records.
.Pp
The expiry date for the SIG records can be set by the
.Fl e
option.
Note that in this context, the expiry date specifies when the SIG
records are no longer valid, not when they are deleted from caches on name
servers.
.Ar end-date
also represents an absolute or relative date.
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation is used as before to indicate an absolute date
and time.
When
.Ar end-date
is +N,
it indicates that the SIG records will expire in N seconds after their
start date.
If
.Ar end-date
is written as now+N,
the SIG records will expire in N seconds after the current time.
When no expiry date is set for the SIG records,
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
defaults to an expire time of 30 days from the start time of the SIG
records.
.Pp
An alternate source of random data can be specified with the
.Fl r
option.
.Ar randomdev
is the name of the file to use to obtain random data.
By default
.Pa /dev/random
is used if this device is available.
If it is not provided by the operating system and no
.Fl r
option is used,
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
will prompt the user for input from the keyboard and use the time
between keystrokes to derive some random data.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option instructs
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
to use pseudo-random data when self-signing the keyset.  This is faster, but
less secure, than using genuinely random data for signing.
This option may be useful when the entropy source is limited.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
option is followed by a time-to-live argument
.Ar TTL
which indicates the TTL value that will be assigned to the assembled KEY
and SIG records in the output file.
.Ar TTL
is expressed in seconds.
If no
.Fl t
option is provided,
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
prints a warning and uses a default TTL of 3600 seconds.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option can be used to make
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
more verbose.
As the debugging/tracing level
.Ar level
increases,
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
generates increasingly detailed reports about what it is doing.
The default level is zero.
.Pp
The
.Fl h
option makes
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
to print a short summary of its options and arguments.
.Pp
If
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
is successful, it creates a file name of the form
.Ar keyset-nnnn. .
This file contains the KEY and SIG records for domain
.Dv nnnn ,
the domain name part from the key file identifier produced when
.Nm dnssec-keygen
created the domain's public and private keys.
The
.Ar keyset
file can then be transferred to the DNS administrator of the parent
zone for them to sign the contents with
.Xr dnssec-signkey 8 .
.Sh EXAMPLE
The following command generates a key set for the DSA key for
.Dv example.com
that was shown in the
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8
man page.
The backslash is for typographic reasons and would not be provided on
the command line when running
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset .
.nf
.Dl # dnssec-makekeyset -t 86400 -s 20000701120000 \e\p
.Dl -e +2592000 Kexample.com.+003+26160
.fi
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-makekeyset
will create a file called
.Pa keyset-example.com.
containing a SIG and KEY record for
.Dv example.com.
These records will have a TTL of 86400 seconds (1 day).
The SIG record becomes valid at noon UTC on July 1st 2000 and expires
30 days (2592000 seconds) later.
.Pp
The DNS administrator for
.Dv example.com
could then send
.Pa keyset-example.com.
to the DNS administrator for
.Dv .com
so that they could sign the resource records in the file.
This assumes that the
.Dv .com
zone is DNSSEC-aware and the administrators of the two zones have some
mechanism for authenticating each other and exchanging the keys and
signatures securely.
