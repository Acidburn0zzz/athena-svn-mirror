.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signzone
is used to sign a zone.
Any
.Ar signedkey
files for the zone to be signed should be present in the current
directory, along with the keys that will be used to sign the zone.
If no
.Ar keyfile
arguments are supplied, the default behaviour is to use all of the zone's
keys that are present in the current directory.
Providing specific
.Ar keyfile
arguments constrains
.Nm dnssec-signzone
to only use those keys for signing the zone.
Each
.Ar keyfile
argument would be an identification string for a key created with
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 .
If the zone to be signed has any secure subzones, the
.Ar signedkey
files for those subzones need to be available in the
current working directory used by
.Nm dnssec-signzone .
.Pp
.Ar zonefile
is the name of the unsigned zone file.
Unless the file name is the same as the name of the zone, the
.Fl o
option should be given.
.Ar origin
will be the fully qualified domain origin for the zone.
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signzone
will generate NXT and SIG records for the zone and produce a signed
version of the zone.
If there is a
.Ar signedkey
file from the zone's parent, the parent's signatures will be
incorporated into the generated signed zone file.
The security status of delegations from the the signed zone
- i.e. whether the child zones are DNSSEC-aware or not - is
set according to the presence or absence of a
.Ar signedkey
file for the child in case.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm dnssec-signzone
generates a file called
.Ar zonefile.signed
containing the signed zone file.
The output file name can be overridden usign the
.Fl f
option.
.\" Don't hyphenate YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
.nh YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signzone
does not verify the signatures by default.
The
.Fl a
option makes it verify the signatures it generated.
.Pp
The date and time when the generated
SIG records become valid can be specified with the
.Fl s
option.
.Ar start-time
can either be an absolute or relative date.
An absolute start time is indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
notation: 20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000.
A relative start time is supplied when
.Ar start-time
is given as +N: N seconds from the current time.
If no
.Fl s
option is supplied, the current date and time is used for the start
time of the SIG records.
.Pp
The expiry date for the SIG records can be set by the
.Fl e
option.
Note that in this context, the expiry date specifies when the SIG
records are no longer valid, not when they are deleted from caches on name
servers.
.Ar end-date
also represents an absolute or relative date.
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation is used as before to indicate an absolute date
and time.
When
.Ar end-date
is +N,
it indicates that the SIG records will expire in N seconds after their
start date.
If
.Ar end-date
is supplied as now+N,
the SIG records will expire in N seconds after the current time.
When no expiry date is set for the SIG records,
.Nm dnssec-signzone
defaults to an expire time of 30 days from the start time of the SIG
records.
.Pp
When a previously signed zone is passed as input to
.Nm dnssec-signzone ,
records may be resigned.  Whether or not to resign records is configurable
by using the
.Fl i
option, which specifies the cycle interval as an offset from the current time
(in seconds).  If a SIG record expires after the cycle interval, it is
retained.  Otherwise, it is considered to be expiring soon, and
.Nm dnssec-signzone
will remove it and generate a new SIG record to replace it.
.Pp
The default cycle interval is one quarter of the difference between the
specified signature end and start dates.  So if the
.Fl e
and
.Fl s
options are not specified,
.Nm dnssec-signzone
generates signatures that are valid for 30 days from the current date
by default, with a cycle interval of 7.5 days.  Therefore, if any SIG records
are due to expire in less than 7.5 days, they would be replaced
with new ones.
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signzone
may need random numbers in the process of signing the zone.
If the system does not have a
.Pa /dev/random
device that can be used for generating random numbers,
.Nm dnssec-signzone
will prompt for keyboard input and use the time intervals between
keystrokes to provide randomness.
The
.Fl r
option overrides this behaviour, making
.Nm dnssec-signzone
use
.Ar randomdev
as a source of random data.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option instructs
.Nm dnssec-signzone
to use pseudo-random data when signing the keys.  This is faster, but
less secure, than using genuinely random data for signing.
This option may be useful when signing large zones or when the
entropy source is limited.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
option causes
.Nm dnssec-signzone
to print various statistics after signing the zone.
.Pp
The
.Fl c
option specifies that the KEY records in the input and output key sets should
have the specified class instead of IN.
.Pp
The
.Fl d
option specifies that
.Nm dnssec-signzone
should look in a directory other than the current directory for signedkey
files.
.Pp
An option of
.Fl h
makes
.Nm dnssec-signzone
print a short summary of its command line options
and arguments.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option can be used to make
.Nm dnssec-signzone
more verbose.
As the debugging/tracing level
.Ar level
increases,
.Nm dnssec-signzone
generates increasingly detailed reports about what it is doing.
The default level is zero.
.Pp
The
.Fl n
option can be used to change the threading behavior.  By default,
.Nm dnssec-signzone
attempts to determine the number of CPUs present, and create one thread
per CPU.  The
.Fl n
option causes a different number of threads to be created.
.Sh EXAMPLE
The example below shows how
.Nm dnssec-signzone
could be used to sign the
.Dv example.com
zone with the key that was generated in the example given in the
man page for
.Xr dnssec-keygen 8 .
The zone file for this zone is
.Dv example.com ,
which is the same as the origin, so there is no need to use the
.Fl o
option to set the origin.
The zone's keys were either appended to the zone file or
incorporated using a
.Dv $INCLUDE
statement.
If there was a
.Ar signedkey
file from the parent zone - i.e.
.Dv signedkey-example.com.
- it should be present in the current directory.
This allows the parent zone's signature to be included in the signed
version of the
.Dv example.com
zone.
.Pp
.Dl # dnssec-signzone example.com Kexample.com.+003+26160
.Pp
.Nm dnssec-signzone
will create a file called
.Dv example.com.signed ,
the signed version of the
.Dv example.com
zone.
This file can then be referenced in a
.Dv zone{}
statement in
.Pa /etc/named.conf
so that it can be loaded by the name server.
