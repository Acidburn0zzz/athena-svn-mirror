.Sh NAME
.Nm rndc
.Nd name server control utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rndc
.Op Fl c Ar config-file
.Op Fl M
.Op Fl m
.Op Fl p Ar port#
.Op Fl s Ar server
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl y Ar key_id
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This command allows the system administrator to control the operation
of a name server.
It supersedes the
.Xr ndc 8
utility that was provided in old BIND releases.
If
.Nm rndc
is invoked with no command line options or arguments, it
prints a short summary of the supported commands and the available
options and their arguments.
.Pp
.Nm rndc
communicates with the name server over a TCP connection,
sending commands authenticated with digital signatures.
In the current versions of
.Nm rndc
and
.Xr named 8
the only supported encryption algorithm is HMAC-MD5, which uses a
shared secret on each end of the connection.
This provides TSIG-style authentication for the command request
and the name server's response.
All commands sent over the channel
must be signed by a key_id known to the server.
.Pp
.Nm rndc
reads its default configuration file,
.Pa /etc/rndc.conf
to determine how to contact the name server and decide what algorithm
and keys is should use.
The
.Fl c
option can be used to specify an alternate configuration file.
.Pp
.Ar server
is the name or address of the server which matches a
.Dv server
statement in the configuration file for
.Nm rndc .
If no
.Ar server
is supplied on the command line, the host named by the
.Dv default-server
clause in the
.Dv option
statement of the configuration file will be used.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
option can be used to make
.Nm rndc
send commands to TCP port number
.Ar port#
on the system running the name server instead of BIND 9's
default control channel port of 953.
.Pp
The
.Fl y
option identifies the
.Ar key_id
to use from the configuration file.
.Ar key_id
must be known by
.Xr named
with the same algorithm and secret string in order for
control message validation to succeed.
If no
.Fl y
option is provided,
.Nm rndc
will first look for a
.Dv key
clause in the
.Dv server
statement of the server being used, or if no
.Dv server
statement is present for that host, then the
.Dv default-key
clause of the
.Dv options
statement.
Note that the configuration file for
.Nm rndc
contains shared secrets which are used to send authenticated
control commands to name servers.
It should therefore not have general read or write access.
.Pp
The
.Fl M ,
.Fl m ,
and
.Fl v
options provided debugging information and are primarily of interest
only to the BIND 9 developers.
They might be changed or removed in future releases.
.Pp
For the complete set of commands supported by rndc, see the
BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual or run
.Nm rndc
without arguments to see its help message.
.Pp
.Sh LIMITATIONS
.Nm rndc
does not yet support all the commands of the BIND 8
.Xr ndc
utility.
.Pp
There is currently no way to provide the shared secret for a key_id
without using the configuration file.
.Pp
Several error messages could be clearer.
For example, trying to connect
from an address that is not in the list of acceptable addresses
configured into
.Xr named
will result in the error message "end of file" when the server
unceremoniously closes the connection.
