.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm named
is a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the BIND 9 distribution
from ISC.  For more information on the DNS, see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035.
.Pp
When invoked without arguments,
.Nm named
will read the default configuration file
.Pa /etc/named.conf ,
read any initial data, and listen for queries.
.Pp
The options to
.Nm named
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
use
.Ar config-file
as the configuration file instead of the default,
.Pa /etc/named.conf .
To ensure that reloading the configuration file continues to 
work after the server has changed its working directory 
due to to a possible 
.Dv directory
option in the configuration file, 
.Ar config-file
should be an absolute pathname.
.It Fl d
set the daemon's debug level to
.Ar debuglevel .
Debugging traces from
.Nm named
become more verbose as the debug level increases.
.It Fl f
run
.Nm named
in the foreground.
.It Fl g
run
.Nm named
in the foreground and force all logging to
.Dv stderr .
.It Fl n
create
.Ar #cpus
worker threads to take advantage of multiple CPUs.
If no option is given,
.Nm named
will try to determine the number of CPUs present and create
one thread per CPU.  If
.Nm named
is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a single worker thread
is created.
.It Fl p
listen for queries on  port
.Ar port#
instead of the default port number, 53.
.It Fl s
write memory usage statistics to
.Dv stdout
on exit.
This option is mainly of interest
to BIND9 developers and may be removed or changed in a future release.
.It Fl t
tells
.Nm named
to chroot() to
.Ar directory
as soon as it is finshed processing command line arguments,
before reading its configuration file.
This should be used in conjunction with the
.Fl u
option, as chrooting a process running as root doesn't 
enhance security on most systems - the way chroot() is defined
allows a process with root privileges to escape the chroot jail.
.It Fl u
run
.Nm named
as UID
.Ar user-id .
.Nm named
will change its UID after it has
carried out any privileged operations, such as
creating sockets that listen on privileged ports.
.Pp
On Linux, 
.Nm named
uses the kernel's capability mechanism to drop
all root privileges except the ability to bind() to a privileged
port.  Unfortunately, this means that the "-u" option only works 
when 
.Nm named
is run on 2.3.99-pre3 or later kernel, since previous
kernels did not allow privileges to be retained after setuid().
.It Fl v
report the version number and exit.
.It Fl x
load data from
.Ar cache-file .
into the cache of the default view.
This option must not be used.
It is only of interest
to BIND9 developers and may be removed or changed in a future release.
.El
.Sh SIGNALS
In routine operation, signals should not be used to \*qcontrol\*q the
name server.
.Nm rndc
should be used instead.
Sending the name server a
.Dv SIGHUP
signal forces a reload of the server.
A
.Dv SIGINT
or
.Dv SIGTERM
signal can be used to gracefully shut down the server.
Sending any other signals to the name server
will have an undefined outcome.
