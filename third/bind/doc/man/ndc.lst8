     This command allows the name server administrator to send various signals
     to the name server, or to restart it.  Zero or more directives may be
     given, from the following list:

     ssttaattuuss    Displays the current status of named(8) as shown by ps(1).

     dduummppddbb    Causes nnaammeedd to dump its database and cache to
               _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p_/_n_a_m_e_d___d_u_m_p_._d_b (uses the INT signal.)

     rreellooaadd    Causes nnaammeedd to check the serial numbers of all primary and
               secondary zones and to reload those that have changed (uses the
               HUP signal.)

     ssttaattss     Causes nnaammeedd to dump its statistics to _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p_/_n_a_m_e_d_._s_t_a_t_s
               (uses the IOT or ABRT signal.)

     ttrraaccee     Causes nnaammeedd to increment its ``tracing level'' by one.  When-
               ever the tracing level is nonzero, trace information will be
               written to _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p_/_n_a_m_e_d_._r_u_n. Higher tracing levels result in
               more detailed information.  (Uses the USR1 signal.)

     nnoottrraaccee   Causes nnaammeedd to set its ``tracing level'' to zero, closing
               _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p_/_n_a_m_e_d_._r_u_n, if it is open (uses the USR2 signal.)

     qquueerryylloogg  Causes nnaammeedd to toggle the ``query logging'' feature, which
               while on will result in a syslog(2) of each incoming query (us-
               es the WINCH signal.)  Note that query logging consumes quite a
               lot of log file space.  This directive may also be given as
               qqrryylloogg.

     ssttaarrtt     Causes nnaammeedd to be started, as long as it isn't already run-
               ning.

     ssttoopp      Causes nnaammeedd to be stopped, if it is running.

     rreessttaarrtt   Causes nnaammeedd to be killed and restarted.

BBUUGGSS
     Arguments to nnaammeedd are not preserved by rreessttaarrtt, or known by ssttaarrtt.

     Some mechanism for controlling the parameters and environment should ex-
     ist.

     Implemented as a sh(1) script.
