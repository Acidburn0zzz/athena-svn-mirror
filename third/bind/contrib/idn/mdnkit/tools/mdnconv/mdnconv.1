.SH NAME
mdnconv \- codeset converter for named.conf and zone master files
.\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmdnconv\fP [\fIoptions..\fP] [\fIfile\fP...]
.\"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mdnconv
is a codeset converter for named configuration files and zone master files.
.B mdnconv
performs codeset conversion specified either by the command-line arguments
or by the configuration file,
and writes the converted text to stdout.
.PP
If file name is specified,
.B mdnconv
converts the contents of the file.  Otherwise,
.B mdnconv
converts
.IR stdin .
.PP
Since
.B mdnconv
is specifically designed for converting internatinalized domain names,
it may not be suitable as a general codeset converter.
.\"
.SH "OPERATION MODES"
.B mdnconv
has two operation modes.
.PP
One is a mode to convert local-encoded domain names to IDN-encoded
one.  Usually this mode is used for preparing domain names to be
listed in named configuration files or zone master files.
In this mode, the following processes are performed in addition to
the codeset (encoding) conversion.
.RS 2
.IP \- 2
local mapping
.IP \- 2
standard domain name preperation (NAMEPREP)
.RE
.PP
Furthermore, delimiter mapping is also performed in case \-delimitermap
command line option is specified.
.PP
The other mode is a reverse convertion, from IDN-encoded domain name to
local-encoded domain names.
Since IDN-ecoded names are usually already normalized by local mapping and
NAMEPREP process, only codeset conversion is performed in this mode.
.\"
.SH OPTIONS
Normally
.B mdnconv
reads system's default configuration file (mdn.conf) and perform
conversion or name preparation according to the parameters specified in
the file.  You can override the setting in the configuration file by
various command line options below.

.SH CONVERSION MECHANISM
Here is a brief step-by-step description of how
.B mdnconv
does its job.
.IP "1. input-side convnersion" 4
.B mdnconv
reads input text line by line, and converts them from the input codeset
to UTF-8 encoding.  Basically this conversion is done using iconv() utility,
but for some special codesets like RACE, special converter will be used.
.br
Normally the whole line is converted, but if the input codeset is an
ACE (ASCII-compatible encoding, such as RACE), a special conversion
prodedure shown below is used:
.RS 4
.IP 1) 3
Find substrings which are valid ASCII domain names (i.e. constructed from
alphanumeric characters and hyphens) in the line.
.IP 2) 3
For each substring found, try converting it to UTF-8.
.IP 3) 3
If the conversion succeeds, replace the substring with the conversion
result. Otherwise, the original substring is retained.
.RE
.IP "2. finding where to process" 4
Then
.B mdnconv
looks for (part of) internationalized domain name in the converted line,
and picks them up for further processing.
.br
.B mdnconv
recognizes the character sequence having the following property as
an internationalized domain name.
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 2
containing at least one non-ASCII character, and
.IP "\(bu" 2
consisting of legal domain name characters (alphabets, digits, hypens),
non-ASCII characters and period.
.RE
.IP "" 4
If you are not quite sure what this means (as I), 
the following regular expression may help you.
.nf
.ft CW

    [-A-Za-z0-9.]*<non-ASCII char>([-A-Za-z0-9.]|<non-ASCII char>)*

.ft P
.fi
For example, only ``www.###.com'' will be picked up from
the following lines (`#' denotes non-ASCII character).
.nf
.ft CW

    www.###.com.    IN CNAME serv.xyz.com.
    serv.xyz.com.   IN A     10.0.0.1

.ft P
.fi
If \-whole option is specified, this step is skipped and the entire line
is subject to further processing.
.IP "3. delimiter mapping" 4
For each string picked up by the last step, delimiter mapping is performed.
That is, substibute certain characters specified as domain name delimiter
with period.
.IP "4. local mapping" 4
Perform local mapping.
If the local mapping is specified by command line option ``\-localmap'',
the specified mapping rule is applied.  Otherwise, find the mapping rule
from the configuration file which matches to the TLD of the name,
and perform mapping according to the matched rule.
.IP "5. nameprep" 4
Perform name preparation (NAMEPREP).  This is a following 3-step process.
.RS 6
.nf
1) Mapping
2) Normalization
3) Prohibited/unassigned character checking
.fi
.RE
.IP "6. output-side conversion" 4
Finally,
.B mdnconv
converts the nameprepped strings from UTF-8 encoding to the output codeset.
And it writes them to stdout together with the rest of the line.
.PP
If
.B mdnconv
operates in the reverse conversion mode, step 3, 4 and 5 above are skipped.
.\"
.SH FILE MANAGEMENT
Maybe the best way to manage named.conf or zone master files that contains
internationalized domain name is to keep them in your local codeset so that
they can be edited with your favorite editor, and generate a version in
the IDN encoding using \fBmdnconv\fP.
.PP
`make' is a convenient tool for this purpose.
Suppose the local codeset version has suffix `.lc', and its ACE version
has suffix `.ace'.  The following Makefile enables you to generate
ACE version from local codeset version by just typing `make'.
.RS 4
.nf
.ft CW

\&.SUFFIXES: .lc .ace
\&.lc.ace:
        mdnconv -in $(LOCALCODE) $(MDNCONVOPT) $< > $@

LOCALCODE = EUC-JP
MDNCONVOPT = 

DESTFILES = db.zone1.ace db.zone2.ace

all: $(DESTFILES)

.SH BUGS
The automatic input-code selection depends on your system, and sometimes
it cannot guess or guess wrong.  It is better to explicitly specify it
using \-in option.
