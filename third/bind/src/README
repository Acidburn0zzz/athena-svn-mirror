	-> Ports to OpenBSD 2.1, SCO UnixWare 2.1.2, AIX 4.

To Support the Effort

	Note that BIND is supported by the Internet Software Consortium, and
	although it is free for use and redistribution and incorporation into
	vendor products and export and anything else you can think of, it
	costs money to produce.  That money comes from ISPs, hardware and
	software vendors, companies who make extensive use of the software,
	and generally kind hearted folk such as yourself.

	The Internet Software Consortium has also commissioned a DHCP server
	implementation, has taken over official support/release of the INN
	system, and supports the Kerberos Version 5 effort at MIT.  You can
	learn more about the ISC's goals and accomplishments from the web page
	at <URL:http://www.isc.org/>.
