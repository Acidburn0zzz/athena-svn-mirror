.SH NAME
look \- display lines beginning with a given string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B look [ \-df ] [ \-t
termchar
.B ]
string
.B [
file
.B ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.I look
utility displays any lines in
.I file
which contain
.I string
as a prefix.
As
.I look
performs a binary search, the lines in
.I file
must be sorted.
.PP
If
.I file
is not specified, the system dictionary file is used, only
alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic
characters is ignored.
.PP
Options:
.IP \fB\-d\fP
Dictionary character set and order, i.e. only alphanumeric characters
are compared.
.IP \fB\-f\fP
Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.
.IP \fB\-t\fP
Specify a string termination character, i.e. only the characters
in
.I string
up to and including the first occurrence of
.I termchar
are compared.
.PP
The
.I look
utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed,
1 if no lines were found, and >1 if an error occurred.
.SH FILES
The system dictionary file.
.SH SEE ALSO
grep(1), sort(1)
.SH COMPATIBILITY
The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters
participated in comparisons when the \-d option was specified.  This
was incorrect and the current man page matches the historic
implementation.
.SH HISTORY
.I Look
appeared in Version 7 AT&T Unix.
