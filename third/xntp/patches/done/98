You asked for feedback.  It works for Irix 6.2 and Ultrix 4.3.

A couple of warnings. 

Irix 6.2 - harmless? warning

cc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include  -g -n32 ntp_io.c
"ntp_io.c", line 1680: warning(1110): statement is unreachable
    msyslog(LOG_ERR, "input_handler: fell out of infinite for(;;)
loop!");
    ^

Ultrix 4.3 - compile warning - seems to work anyway

cc -c -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I.. -I../include  -g ntp_util.c
cfe: Warning: ntp_util.c, line 470: prototype declaration and
non-prototype defi
nition found for record_loop_stats, the type of this parameter is not
compatible
 with the type after applying default argument promotion
     u_char poll;
 -----------^

Problem with the third argument to record_loop_stats
In ntp_util.c line 470 we have u_char poll.
In ntpd.h line 180 it is an int
