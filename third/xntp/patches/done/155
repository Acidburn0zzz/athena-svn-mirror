Hi Harlan,


How are things? Did you make sense of all my mail? One minor correction to
configure.in It is for big endian targets...

In the section  marked ### below is changed to be correct.

#AC_C_BIGENDIAN     dnl CROSS-COMPILE?
    case "$host" in
     $target)
        AC_C_BIG_ENDIAN
        ;;
     *) case "$target" in
         i*86-*-vxworks*)
           # LITTLEENDIAN
            ;;
         *-*-vxworks*)                      # was bigendian_machine     ###
            AC_DEFINE(WORDS_BIGENDIAN)
            ;;
    esac

Let me know what is happening.

Keep well

Casey
