Not even two days because in louie.udel.edu the file is dated Feb 19 10:03.

Anyway, it seems to work on Linux 2.0.29 and Digital UNIX V3.2C so far.

Btw, configure --help tells there are options --enable-DES and --enable-MD5.
But configure looks for des and md5 in small letters: --disable-md5
--disable-des do work. Using the options written in small letters is ok on
the Linux, but Digital's compiler doesn't like the empty "union { }" in
authkeys.c:

struct savekey {
        struct savekey *next;
        union {
#ifdef  DES
            u_int32 DES_key[2];
#endif
#ifdef  MD5
            char MD5_key[32];
#endif
        } k;
        u_long keyid;
        u_short flags;
#ifdef  MD5
        int keylen;
#endif
};
