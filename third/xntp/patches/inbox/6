Harlan,

playing around with PPS code, I found two minor bugs in xntp3-5.90.2:

In refclock_msfees the file <stropts.h> is unconditionally included. 
May system did have none, so the make failed. Maybe autoconf should 
modify the Makefile so that refclock_msfees.c is not selected if 
there's no <stropts.h>.

In refclock_atom there's a define PPSX that is not present in 
config.h. If you define it, the make will fail, because "fdpps" is 
undefined. Solution: Just remove the lines above and below the 
declaration (a #ifndef .. #endif).
