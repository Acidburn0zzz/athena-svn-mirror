			    UNIX QUICK BUILD NOTES

1) Look in imap-2000/Makefile and find your system type code, e.g. slx for
   glibc Linux and/or Linux with shadow password security.

2) Type "make" followed by the system type, e.g. "make slx".

3) Install the POP2 daemon (ipopd/ipop2d), the POP3 daemon (ipopd/ipop3d), and
   the IMAP daemon (imapd/imapd) on a system directory of your choosing.

4) Update /etc/services to register the pop2 service on TCP port 109, the
   pop3 service on TCP port 110, and the imap service on TCP port 143.  Also
   update Yellow Pages/NIS/NetInfo/etc. if appropriate on your system.

5) Update /etc/inetd.conf to invoke the POP2, POP3, and IMAP daemons on their
   associated services.

6) That's all!

Read the file docs/BUILD if you need more detailed information and/or you
don't understand these quick build instructions.

			     MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

     mtest has been run under UNIX, DOS, Windows, NT, Macintosh, TOPS-20, and
VMS.  It is a very primitive interface, however, and is suited mainly as a
model of how to write a main program for c-client.  You should take a look at
the source to figure out how to use it.  Briefly, it first asks for a mailbox
name (either a local file path or an IMAP mailbox in the form
"{hostname}mailbox") and then puts you in a command mode where "?" will give
you a list of commands.

     Pine is available separately on the FTP.CAC.Washington.EDU archives.

     The focus of development and support is for UNIX and NT/Win32 (including
Windows 95/98).  The other ports are not frequently used or tested, and may be
incomplete.
