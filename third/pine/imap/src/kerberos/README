		       Kerberos 4 IMAP Patchkit
			   1 December 1998

     The Kerberos 4 IMAP patchkit consists of a set of modules and
patches to the IMAP toolkit to enable Kerberos 4 client-only support
in c-client.  There is server support.

     This patchkit is completely unsupported.  Use it at your own
risk.

     To build the IMAP tookit with the Kerberos 4 IMAP patchkit, move
the entire contents of the kerberos/ directory into
imap-4.???/src/kerberos, then do a make command with krb listed as one
of the EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS.

     For example, assuming that you just obtained imap-4.5.tar.Z and
this kerberos4-patches.tar.Z distribution and desire to build on a
Digital UNIX 4.0 system.  You would follow a procedure somewhat like
this:
	% zcat imap-4.5.tar.Z | tar xf -
	% zcat kerberos4-patches.tar.Z | tar xf -
	% mv kerberos imap-4.5/src
	% cd imap-4.5
	% make os4 EXTRAAUTHENTICATORS=krb
