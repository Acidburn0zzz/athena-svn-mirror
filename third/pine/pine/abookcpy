There used to be an abookcpy.c utility program which could be used to
copy a local address book file to a remote address book folder. That program
has been replaced with pine run with particular flags. The old abookcpy
was used like this:

  abookcpy [-t trimsize] <local_abook_file> <remote_abook_folder>

This is replaced with

  pine -copy_abook <local_abook_file> <remote_abook_folder>

You may use the flag

    -remote-abook-history=<trimsize+1>

to get the same trimming as before. The default is

    -remote-abook-history=3
