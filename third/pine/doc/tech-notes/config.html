<H1>Configuration and Preferences</H1>

<H2><A NAME="pine-conf">Pine Configuration</A></H2>

There is very little in <EM>Pine</EM> which <STRONG>requires</STRONG> compile-time
configuration. In most cases, the compiled-in preferences will suit users
and administrators just fine. When running <EM>Pine</EM> on a UNIX system, the
default built-in configuration can be changed by setting variables in the
system configuration files, <CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf</CODE>
or <CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed</CODE>.
(Actually, these files are whatever the definitions for
<CODE>SYSTEM_PINERC</CODE> and <CODE>SYSTEM_PINERC_FIXED</CODE>
in pine/osdep/os-xxx.h are set to.)
The location of the pine.conf file can be changed with the -P command line
argument.
Both <EM>Pine</EM>
and <EM>PC-Pine</EM> also use personal (user-based) configuration files.
On UNIX machines, the personal configuration file is the
file <CODE>~/.pinerc</CODE>. 
For <EM>PC-Pine</EM> systems, the personal configuration file is in
<CODE>$PINERC</CODE> or <CODE>&lt;PineRC registry value&gt;</CODE> or 
<CODE>$HOME\PINE\PINERC</CODE> or
<CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>dir<CODE>&gt;\PINERC</CODE>.
Or the personal configuration file can be specified with the -p command
line argument.
<P>
After the personal configuration, <EM>Pine</EM> may optionally use
a personal exceptions configuration file which is specified with the
command line option &quot;-x exceptions_config&quot;.
&quot;Exceptions_config&quot; may be either a local file or a remote
configuration folder.
For Unix <EM>Pine</EM>, if you don't have a &quot;-x&quot; command line option,
<EM>Pine</EM> will look for the file &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot;
in the same local directory that the regular config file is located in.
If the regular config file is remote then Unix <EM>Pine</EM> looks in the home
directory for &quot;<CODE>.pinercex</CODE>&quot;.
<P>
For <EM>PC-Pine</EM>, if you don't have a &quot;-x&quot; command line option,
<EM>PC-Pine</EM> will use the value of the
environment variable <CODE>$PINERCEX</CODE>.
If that is not set, <EM>PC-Pine</EM> will look for
the local file &quot;<CODE>PINERCEX</CODE>&quot;
in the same local directory that the regular config file is located in.
If the regular config file is remote then <EM>PC-Pine</EM> looks in the
local directory specfied by the &quot;-aux local_directory&quot; command
line argument, or the directory <CODE>$HOME&#92;PINE</CODE>, or
in <CODE>&lt;PINE.EXE </CODE>directory<CODE>&gt;</CODE>.
<P>

The syntax of a non-list configuration variable is this: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;variable&gt; = &lt;value&gt;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

If the value is absent then the variable is unset.  To set a variable to
the empty value the syntax is "".  This is equivalent to an absent value
except that it overrides any system-wide value that may be set.  Quotes
may be used around any value.  All values are strings and end at the end
of the line or the closing quote.  Leading and trailing space is ignored
unless it is included in the quotes.  There is one variable,
<EM>use-only-domain-name</EM>, for which the only
appropriate values are <EM>yes</EM> and <EM>no</EM>. That's because it is
a variable from the early days of <EM>Pine</EM> before features existed.
<P>

There is also a
second type of variable, lists.  A list is a comma-separated list of
values.  The syntax for a list is: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&lt;variable&gt; = &lt;value&gt; [, &lt;value&gt; , ... ]<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

A list can be continued on subsequent lines by beginning the line with
white-space.  Both the per-user and global configuration files may contain
comments which are lines beginning with a <CODE>#.</CODE> <P>

For UNIX <EM>Pine</EM>, there are five ways in which each variable can be set.
In decreasing order of precedence they are: 

<OL>

<LI> the system-wide <EM>fixed</EM> configuration file

<LI> a command line argument

<LI> the personal exceptions file

<LI> the personal configuration file

<LI> the system-wide configuration file.

</OL><P>

If the variable is not set in any of those places, there is a default
setting in the source code.
<P>
So, system-wide fixed settings always take precedence over command line
flags, which take precedence over per-user exception settings, which take precedence over per-user settings, which take precedence
over system-wide configuration settings.
<EM>PC-Pine</EM> has the same list, except that it
does not use a system-wide <EM>fixed</EM> configuration file.
This can be modified slightly by using inheritance, which is covered below.
<P>

You may get a sample/fresh copy of the system configuration file by
running <EM>Pine -conf.</EM> The result will be printed on the standard
output with short comments describing each variable.  (The online help in
the Setup screens provides longer comments.) If you need to fix some
of the configuration variables, you would use the same template for the
fixed configuration file as for the regular system-wide configuration
file.  (If it isn't clear, the purpose of the fixed configuration file is
to allow system administrators to restrict the configurability of <EM>Pine</EM>.
It is by no means a bullet-proof method.) <EM>Pine</EM> will automatically create
the personal configuration file the first time it is run, so there is no
need to generate a sample.  <EM>Pine</EM> reads and writes the personal
configuration file occasionally during normal operation.  Users will not
normally look at their personal configuration file, but will use the
Setup screens from within <EM>Pine</EM> to set the values in this file.  If a
user does add additional comments to the personal configuration file they
will be retained.
<P>

References to environment variables may be included in the <EM>Pine</EM>
configuration files.  The format is <CODE>$variable</CODE> or
<CODE>${variable}.</CODE> The character <CODE>~</CODE> will be expanded to the
<CODE>$HOME</CODE> environment variable.  <P>

When environment variables are used for <EM>Pine</EM> settings which take lists,
you must have an environment variable set for each member of the list. 
That is, <EM>Pine</EM> won't properly recognize an environment variable which is
set equal to a comma-delimited list.  It is OK to reference unset
environment variables in the <EM>Pine</EM> configuration file, which
will expand to nothing.  <P>

<H3>Remote and Local Configuration</H3>

Beginning with <EM>Pine</EM> 4.30 there are two types of storage
for configuration information.
<EM>Local</EM> configuration files are used by default.
These are just regular files on the UNIX system or on the PC.
This is the only kind of configuration storage <EM>Pine</EM> used prior
to 4.30.
<EM>Remote</EM> configuration folders are stored on an IMAP server.
The advantage of using a remote configuration is that the same information
may be accessed from multiple platforms.
For example, if you use one computer at work and another at home, the same
configuration could be used from both places.
A configuration change from one place would be seen in both places.
Technical information about remote configuration is in
<A HREF="low-level.html#remote-config"><EM>Remote Configuration</EM></A>.

<H3>Generic and Exceptional Configuration</H3>

If you use <EM>Pine</EM> from more than one platform it may be convenient
to split your configuration information into two pieces, a generic piece
and exceptions which apply to a particular platform.
For example, suppose you use <EM>Pine</EM> from home and from work.
Most of your configuration settings are probably the
same in both locations, so those settings belong in the generic settings
configuration.
However, you may use a different SMTP server and INBOX
from home than you do from work.
The &quot;smtp-server&quot; and &quot;inbox-path&quot; variables could be
part of your exceptional configuration so that they could be different in the
two places.
<P>
Beginning with <EM>Pine</EM> 4.30 you can use the command line option
&quot;-x config&quot;
to split your configuration into generic and exceptional pieces.
Config may be either local or remote.
<P>
For most people, splitting the configuration information into two pieces is
only going to be useful if the generic information is accessed remotely.
If you already have a local pinerc file with settings you like you may find
that the command Setup/RemoteConfigSetup will be useful in helping you
convert to a remote configuration.
The command line flag
<A HREF="cmd-line.html#copy_pinerc">copy_pinerc</A>
may also be useful.

<H3>Configuration Inheritance</H3>

Configuration inheritance is a power user feature.
It is confusing and not completely supported by the configuration
user interface.
<P>
For configuration variables which are lists, like &quot;smtp-server&quot; or
&quot;incoming-folders&quot;,
the inheritance mechanism makes it possible to <EM>combine</EM>
the values of options from different configuration locations instead
of <EM>replacing</EM> the value.
<A HREF="config-notes.html#config-inheritance">Configuration Inheritance</A>
has more information about how inheritance is used.
<P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="gen-conf">General Configuration Variables</A></H2>

The following is a list of all <EM>Pine</EM> configuration variables, in
alphabetical order.  Note that not all variables apply to all versions of
<EM>Pine</EM> and that some variables are only applicable in a system configuration
file and some are only applicable in a personal configuration file.
These are configuration <EM>variables</EM>.
<A HREF="#features-conf">Configuration <EM>Features</EM></A> 
are in a separate section.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> <A NAME="addrbook-sort-rule"><EM>addrbook-sort-rule</EM></A>

<DD> This variable sets up the default address book sorting.  Currently,
<EM>Pine</EM> will accept the values <EM>dont-sort</EM>,
<EM>fullname-with-lists-last</EM>, <EM>fullname</EM>,
<EM>nickname-with-lists-last</EM>, and <EM>nickname</EM>.  The default is
to sort by fullname with lists last.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="pers-abook"><EM>address-book</EM></A>

<DD> A list of personal address books.
Each entry in the list is an
optional nickname followed by a pathname or file name relative to the home
directory.
The nickname is separated from the rest of the line with whitespace.
Instead of a local pathname or file name, a remote folder name can be given.
This causes the address book to
be a <A HREF="low-level.html#addrbook"><EM>Remote address book</EM></A>.
Remote folder syntax is discussed in
<A HREF="config-notes.html#remote-folders">Syntax for Remote Folders</A>.
This list of address books will be combined with the
<A HREF="#glob-abook"><EM>global-address-book</EM></A>
list to arrive at the complete set of address books.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="abook-formats"><EM>addressbook-formats</EM></A>

<DD> This option specifies the format that address books are displayed in. 
By default, address books are displayed with the nicknames in the first
column, the fullnames in the second column, and addresses in the third
column.  The system figures out reasonable defaults for the widths of the
columns.  An address book may be given a different format by listing
special tokens in the order you want them to display.  The possible tokens
are NICKNAME, FULLNAME, ADDRESS, FCC, and COMMENT. More details are included
in the online help for this variable. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="alt-addresses"><EM>alt-addresses</EM></A>

<DD> This option provides a place for you to list alternate email
addresses you may have.  If set, the option affects the behavior of the
<EM>Reply</EM> command and the <EM>+</EM> symbol in the "Folder Index", which
denotes that a message has been addressed specifically to you. <P>
 
In the default INDEX display
the personal name (or email address) of
the person listed in the message's &quot;From:&quot; header
field is usually displayed except when that address is yours or one of your
alternate addresses.
In that case you will usually see the name of
the first person specified in the
message's &quot;To:&quot; header field
with the prefix &quot;To: &quot; prepended. <P>

With respect to <EM>Reply</EM>, the <EM>Reply to All</EM> option will
exclude addresses listed here. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="bugs-add"><EM>bugs-additional-data</EM></A>

<DD> System-wide configuration files only.  Program/Script used by
<EM>Report Bug</EM> command.  Output from the program/script is
captured and attached to the bug report. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="bugs"><EM>bugs-fullname</EM></A>,
<EM>bugs-address</EM>, <EM>local-fullname</EM>, <EM>local-address</EM>, 
<EM>suggest-fullname</EM>, and <EM>suggest-address</EM>

<DD> System-wide configuration files only.  These are used by the bug
report commands which can be accessed from some of the Help screens.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="char-set"><EM>character-set</EM></A>

<DD> This sets the character set used by the terminal.  Currently
appropriate values are <EM>US-ASCII</EM>,
<EM>ISO-8859-1</EM> through <EM>ISO-8859-9</EM> and
<EM>ISO-2022-JP</EM>. See the section on
<A HREF="low-level.html#char-set">International Character Sets</EM></A> for more
details. The default is <EM>US-ASCII</EM>.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="color-style"><EM>color-style</EM></A>

<DD> UNIX <EM>Pine</EM> only (color is automatically on with <EM>PC-Pine</EM>).
If the terminal or terminal emulator you are using is capable of displaying
colors, this variable controls whether or not
color will be used in <EM>Pine</EM>.
If you turn color on and things are set up correctly,
you should see color appear on the screen immmediately.
Modern terminal emulators are usually capable of displaying colors.
<P>
This variable may be set to any of the following values:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>no-color</DT>
<DD>Don't use color.
</DD>

<DT>use-termdef</DT>
<DD>In order to decide if your terminal is capable of color,
<EM>Pine</EM> looks in
the terminal capabilities database, TERMINFO or TERMCAP, depending on
how <EM>Pine</EM> was compiled.
This is a good option to choose if you switch between a color and a non-color
terminal with the same <EM>Pine</EM> configuration.
<EM>Pine</EM> will know to use color on the color terminal because
it is described
in the termcap entry, and <EM>Pine</EM> will know to use black and white on the
non-color terminal.
<A HREF="config-notes.html#color-config-notes">Color Details</A>
has more information about configuring a termcap entry for color.
This is usually something a system administrator does.
</DD>

<DT>force-ansi-8color</DT>
<DD>Because setting up a termcap entry is confusing and because the
terminal capabilities database is often not correctly configured for color,
this choice and the next may be easier for you to use.
If your terminal emulator responds to ANSI color escape sequences, which
many do, this option will
cause <EM>Pine</EM> to believe your terminal will respond
to the escape sequences which produce eight different foreground and background
colors.
The escape sequences used to set the foreground colors are

  <P><CENTER>ESC&nbsp;[&nbsp;3&nbsp;&lt;color_number&gt;&nbsp;m</CENTER><P>

where the color_number is an ASCII digit between 0 and 7.
The numbers 0 through 7 should correspond to the colors black, red, green,
yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
Some terminal emulators use a pre-ANSI scheme which swaps
the colors blue and red and the colors yellow and cyan.
This will cause the default colors to be different, but other than that
things should work fine.
The escape sequences used to set the background colors are the same
as for the foreground colors except a &quot;4&quot; replaces the &quot;3&quot;.
<P>
Note: With the Tera Term terminal emulator this setting works well.
You should also have the Tera Term &quot;Full color&quot; option turned OFF.
You may find the &quot;Full color&quot; option in Tera Term's &quot;Setup&quot;
menu, in the &quot;Window&quot; submenu.
</DD>

<DT>force-ansi-16color</DT>
<DD>Many terminal emulators know about the same eight colors above
plus eight more.
This option attempts to use all 16 colors.
The same escape sequences as for the eight-color terminal are used
for the first eight colors.
The escape sequences used to set foreground colors 8-15 are the same as
for 0-7 except the &quot;3&quot; is replaced with a &quot;9&quot;.
The background color sequences for colors 8-15 are the same as for 0-7
except the &quot;4&quot; is replaced with &quot;10&quot;.
You can tell if the 16 colors are working by turning on this option
and then going into one of the color configuration screens, for example,
the configuration screen for Normal Color.
If you see 16 different colors to select from, it's working.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The normal default is &quot;no-color&quot;.
<P>
Once you've turned on color you may set the
colors of many objects on the screen individually.
The <A HREF="#color-config">Color Configuration</A> section has more
information, or you may just try it by
running the &quot;Setup&quot; command and typing &quot;K&quot;
for Kolor to enter the color configuration screen (Kolor instead of Color
because C means Config).
Most categories of color which <EM>Pine</EM> supports are configurable there.
<A HREF="#index-color-config">Index line color</A> is configured separately.
<P>
Beginning with <EM>Pine</EM> 4.41, the default names of some colors were changed
in order to have better interoperability between <EM>PC-Pine</EM> and Unix
<EM>Pine</EM> with both eight and 16-color terminals.
Both <EM>PC-Pine</EM> and 8-color Unix <EM>Pine</EM> will interpret the
colors named color008, color009, ..., color015 as black, red, ..., white.
When changing a configuration color they will put the colors black, color009,
color010, ..., color015 into the config file.
That is, the colors red, green, ..., white will only appear in the config
file if put there manually or if they were already there from an older
version of <EM>Pine</EM>.
The reason for this is because with 16-color xterm the colors red, green, ...,
white are actually two-thirds intensity colors, and the colors color009,
color010, ..., color015 (in pine terminology) are full intensity colors
which better match the default eight of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> or 8-color
Unix terminal emulators.
The idea is that you can use the eight colors of an 8-color terminal on
a 16-color terminal and with <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
Those eight colors will be about the same in all three situations.
<P>
In pre-4.41 <EM>PC-Pine</EM> the three default grays offered were called
color008, color009, and color010.
Since this conflicts with three of the colors on 16-color terminals these
three colors have been renamed colorlgr, colormgr, and colordgr.
<EM>PC-Pine</EM> will attempt to automatically change those color names
the first time you run a version higher than 4.40.
If that fails for some reason, you will see your old light grays displayed as
black, your old medium grays displayed as red,
and your old dark grays displayed as green.
You may fix these from within the <EM>PC-Pine</EM> color config screens.
If you then go back to running a pre-4.41 version of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> the
colors with the new names (colorlgr...) will show up as Normally colored
text.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="composer-wrap-column"><EM>composer-wrap-column</EM></A>

<DD> This option specifies an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s Composer.  This gives the
maximum width that auto-wrapped lines will have.  It's also the maximum
width of lines justified using the ^J Justify command.  The normal default
is <EM>74</EM>.  The largest allowed setting is normally <EM>80</EM> in order to
prevent very long lines from being sent in outgoing mail.  When the mail
is actually sent, trailing spaces will be stripped off of each line.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="current-indexline-style"><EM>current-indexline-style</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#cur-il-style"><EM>current-indexline-style</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="cust-hdr"><EM>customized-hdrs</EM></A>

<DD> Add these custom headers when composing.  Also possible to add
default values to these custom headers or to any of the standard headers. 
This is a list variable.  Each entry in the list is a header name (the
actual header name that will appear in the message) followed by an
optional colon and value.  For example, if a Reply-to header was needed
because it was different from the From address, that could be accomplished
with: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
    customized-hdrs=Reply-to: fred_flintstone@bedrock.net <BR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Leaving the optional value out allows the user to fill it in when composing
a message. If it isn't filled in, it won't be included in the message.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="def-comp"><EM>default-composer-hdrs</EM></A>

<DD> Show only these headers (by default) when composing a message.  This
list may include headers defined in the <EM>customized-hdrs</EM> list. 
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="def-fcc"><EM>default-fcc</EM></A>	

<DD> The name of the folder to which all outgoing mail goes is set here. 
The compiled-in default is <EM>sent-mail</EM> (UNIX) or <EM>sentmail</EM>
(PC).  It can be set to "" (two double quotes with nothing between them)
to turn off saving copies of outgoing mail.  If <EM>default-fcc</EM> is a
relative file name, then it is relative to your default collection for
saves (see <A HREF="#fold-coll"><EM>folder-collections</EM></A>).  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="def-save"><EM>default-saved-msg-folder</EM></A>

<DD> This option determines the default folder name for <EM>Saves</EM>...
If this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for saves.
Any valid folder specification, local or IMAP, is allowed.  This default
folder only applies when the
<A HREF="#saved-msg-name"><EM>saved-msg-name-rule</EM></A>
doesn't override it.
Unix <EM>Pine</EM> default is normally
<EM>saved-messages</EM> in the default folder collection.
<EM>PC-Pine</EM> default is <EM>SAVEMAIL</EM>
(normally stored as <EM>SAVEMAIL.MTX</EM>). <P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-these-drivers"><EM>disable-these-drivers</EM></A>

<DD> This variable is a list of mail drivers which will be disabled.
The candidates for disabling are listed below.
There may be more in the future if you compile <EM>Pine</EM> with
a newer version of the c-client library.
<P>

<UL>
<LI> mbox
<LI> mbx
<LI> mh
<LI> mmdf
<LI> mtx
<LI> mx
<LI> news
<LI> phile
<LI> tenex
<LI> unix
</UL>
<P>

The <EM>mbox</EM> driver enables the following behavior: if there is a
file called <CODE>mbox</CODE>
in your home directory, and if that file is either empty or in Unix mailbox
format, then every time you open <EM>INBOX</EM> the <EM>mbox</EM> driver
will automatically transfer mail from the system mail spool directory into the
<CODE>mbox</CODE> file and
delete it from the spool directory. If you disable the <EM>mbox</EM> driver,
this will not happen.
<P>

It is not recommended to disable the driver which supports the system default
mailbox format. On most non-SCO systems, that driver is the
<EM>unix</EM> driver.
On most SCO systems, it is the <EM>mmdf</EM> driver.
The system default driver may be
configured to something else on your system; check with your system manager
for additional information.
<P>

It is most likely not very useful for you to disable any of the drivers other
than possibly <EM>mbox</EM>.
You could disable some of the others if you know for
certain that you don't need them but the performance gain in doing so
is very modest.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-these-auths"><EM>disable-these-authenticators</EM></A>

<DD> This variable is a list of SASL (Simple Authentication and Security
Layer) authenticators which will be disabled.
SASL is a mechanism for
authenticating to IMAP, POP3, SMTP, and other network servers.
<P>

<EM>Pine</EM> matches its list of supported authenticators with the server to
determine the most secure authenticator that is supported by both.
If no matching authenticators are found, <EM>Pine</EM> will revert to plaintext
login (or, in the case of SMTP, will be unable to authenticate at all).
<P>

The candidates for disabling are listed below.
There may be more if you compile <EM>Pine</EM> with additional authenticators
and/or a newer version of the c-client library.
<P>

<UL>
<LI> GSSAPI
<LI> CRAM-MD5
<LI> PLAIN
<LI> LOGIN
</UL>
<P>

Normally, you will not disable any authenticators.
There are two exceptions:
<P>

<OL>
<LI> You use a broken server that advertises an authenticator,
but does not actually implement it.
<LI> You have a Kerberos-capable version of <EM>Pine</EM> and the server is
also Kerberos-capable, but you can not obtain Kerberos
credentials on the server machine, thus you desire to disable
GSSAPI (which in turn disables <EM>Pine</EM>'s Kerberos support).
</OL>

<P>
It is never necessary to disable authenticators, since <EM>Pine</EM> will try
other authenticators before giving up.
However, disabling the relevant authenticator avoids annoying error messages.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="display-filters"><EM>display-filters</EM></A>

<DD> This option defines a list of text-filtering commands (programs or
scripts) that may be used to filter text portions of received messages
prior to their use (e.g., presentation in the "Message Text" display
screen).  For security reasons, the full path name of the filter command
must be specified.
<P>
Display filters do not work with <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

The command is executed and the message is piped into its standard input. 
The standard output of the command is read back by <EM>Pine</EM>.  The
<EM>_TMPFILE_</EM> token (see below) overrides this default behavior. 

<P> 
The filter's use is based on the configured <EM>trigger</EM> string.  The
format of a filter definition is:

<P>   
<CENTER>&lt;trigger&gt; &lt;command&gt; &lt;arguments&gt;</CENTER>

<P>
You can specify as many filters as you wish, separating them with a comma.  
Each filter can have only one trigger and command.  Thus, two trigger 
strings which invoke the same command require separate filter 
specifications. 

<P> 
The <EM>trigger</EM> is simply text that, if found in the message,
will invoke the associated command.  If the trigger contains any space
characters, it must be placed within quotes.  Likewise, should you
wish a filter to be invoked unconditionally, define the trigger as the
null string, &quot;&quot; (two consecutive double-quote characters).  If the
trigger string is found anywhere in the text of the message the filter
is invoked.  Placing the trigger text within the tokens defined below
changes where within the text the trigger must be before considering
it a match.

<P>  
Trigger Modifying Tokens:
<DL>
<DT><EM>_CHARSET(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</EM>
<DD>This token tells <EM>Pine</EM> to invoke the supplied command
if the text is in a character set matching <VAR>string</VAR>
(e.g., ISO-8859-2 or ISO-2022-JP).

<DT><EM>_LEADING(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</EM>
<DD>This token tells <EM>Pine</EM> to invoke the supplied command
if the enclosed <VAR>string</VAR> is found to be the first
non-whitespace text.
<BR>NOTE: Quotes are necessary if <VAR>string</VAR> contains
the space character.

<DT><EM>_BEGINNING(<VAR>string</VAR>)_</EM>
<DD>This token tells <EM>Pine</EM> to invoke the supplied command
if the enclosed <VAR>string</VAR> is found at the beginning
of any line in the text.
<BR>NOTE: Quotes are necessary if <VAR>string</VAR> contains
the space character.
</DL>

<P>
The &quot;command&quot; and &quot;arguments&quot; portion is simply
the command line to be invoked if the trigger string is found.  Below
are tokens that <EM>Pine</EM> will recognize and replace with special values
when the command is actually invoked.

<P>
Command Modifying Tokens:

<DL>
<DT><EM>_TMPFILE_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of the temporary 
file containing the text to be filtered.  <EM>Pine</EM> 
expects the filter to replace this data with the 
filter's result.

NOTE: Use of this token implies that the text to 
be filtered is not piped into standard input of the 
executed command and its standard output is ignored. 
<EM>Pine</EM> restores the tty modes before invoking the
filter in case the filter interacts with the user
via its own standard input and output.  
                        
<DT><EM>_RESULTFILE_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file intended to contain a status message from the 
filter.  <EM>Pine</EM> displays this in the message status 
field. 
 
<DT><EM>_DATAFILE_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file that <EM>Pine</EM> creates once per session and deletes 
upon exit.  The file is intended to be used by the 
filter to store state information between instances 
of the filter.
   
<DT><EM>_PREPENDKEY_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token indicates that a random
number will be passed down the input stream before the message text.
This number could be used as a session key.
It does not appear as a command-line argument.
It is sent in this way to improve security.
The number is unique to the current <EM>Pine</EM> session
and is only generated once per session.
</DL>

<P>
Performance caveat/considerations:
<BR>
Testing for the trigger and invoking the filter doesn't come for free.
There is overhead associated with searching for the trigger string, testing
for the filter's existence and actually piping the text through the filter.
The impact can be reduced if the Trigger Modifying Tokens above are 
employed.
<P>
Limitation:
<BR>
If Header Colors are being used, the sequences of bytes which indicate
color changes will be contained in the text which is passed to the
display-filter.
If this causes problems you'll need to turn off Header Colors.
The thirteen bytes which indicate a color change are
the character \377 followed by
\010 for a foreground color or \011 for a background color.
Then comes eleven characters of RGB data which looks something like
255,&nbsp;&nbsp;0,255, depending on the particular color, of course.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="download-command"><EM>download-command</EM></A>

<DD> This option affects the behavior of the <EM>Export</EM> command.
It specifies a Unix program name, and any necessary command line arguments,
that <EM>Pine</EM> can use to transfer the exported message to your
personal computer's disk.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="download-command-prefix"><EM>download-command-prefix</EM></A>

<DD> This option is used in conjunction with the <EM>download-command</EM>
option. 
It defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard
output) immediately prior to starting the download command. This is
useful for integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit command
passing (e.g., Kermit's APC method). <P>
 
<DT> <A NAME="editor"><EM>editor</EM></A>

<DD> UNIX <EM>Pine</EM> only.  Sets the name of the alternate editor for composing
mail (message text only, not headers).  It will be invoked with the "^_"
command or it will be invoked automatically if the
<A HREF="#enable-alt-imp"><EM>enable-alternate-editor-implicitly</EM></A>
feature is set.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="empty-header-message"><EM>empty-header-message</EM></A>

<DD> When sending, if all of the To, Cc, and Newsgroups fields are empty,
<EM>Pine</EM> will put a special address in the To line. The default value is
"undisclosed-recipients: ;". The reason for this is to avoid
embarrassment caused by some Internet mail transfer software that
interprets a "missing" To: header as an error and replaces it with an
Apparently-to: header that may contain the addresses you entered on the
Bcc: line, defeating the purpose of the Bcc. You may change the part
of this message that comes before the ": ;" by setting the
<EM>empty-header-message</EM> variable to something else.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="fcc-name-rule"><EM>fcc-name-rule</EM></A>

<DD> Determines default folder name for fcc when composing.  Currently,
<EM>Pine</EM> will accept the values <EM>default-fcc</EM>, <EM>by-recipient</EM>,
or <EM>last-fcc-used</EM>.  If set to <EM>default-fcc</EM>, then <EM>Pine</EM> will
use the value defined in the <A HREF="#def-fcc"><EM>default-fcc</EM></A>
variable (which itself
has a default) for the Fcc header field.  If set to <EM>by-recipient</EM>,
then <EM>Pine</EM> will use the name of the recipient as a folder name for the fcc. 
The relevant recipient is the first address in the To field.  If set to
"last-fcc-used", then <EM>Pine</EM> will offer to Fcc to whatever folder
you used previously.
In all cases, the field can still be edited after it is
initially assigned.  If the fcc field in the address book is set for the
first To address, that value over-rides any value derived from this rule. 
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="feat-list"><EM>feature-list</EM></A>

<DD> This is a list of the many features (options) which may be turned on
or off. There is a separate section titled 
<A HREF="#features-conf">Configuration Features</A> which explains
each of the features. There is some additional explanation about the
<EM>feature-list</EM> variable itself
in <A HREF="config-notes.html#feature-list"><EM>Feature List Variable</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="file-directory"><EM>file-directory</EM></A>

<DD> <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.
This value affects the Composer's &quot;^J Attach&quot; command, 
the Attachment Index Screen's &quot;S Save&quot; command, and the
Message Index's &quot;E Export&quot; command.

<P>
Normally, when a filename is supplied that lacks a leading &quot;path&quot;
component, <EM>Pine</EM> assumes the file exists in the user's home directory.
Under Windows operating systems, this definition isn't always clear.  This 
feature allows you to explictly set where <EM>Pine</EM> should look for files
without a leading path.

<P>
NOTE: this feature's value is ignored if either 
<A HREF="#use-current-dir"><EM>use-current-dir</EM></A> feature
is set or the PINERC has a value for the
<A HREF="#operating-dir"><EM>operating-dir</EM></A> variable.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="fold-coll"><EM>folder-collections</EM></A>

<DD> This is a list of one or more collections where saved mail is stored. 
See the sections describing
<A HREF="config-notes.html#collections">folder collections and collection syntax</A> for more information.
The first collection in this list is the default
collection for <EM>Save</EM>s,
including <A HREF="#def-fcc"><EM>default-fcc</EM>'s</A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="folder-ext"><EM>folder-extension</EM></A>

<DD> <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only. File extension used for local folder names. This
is <CODE>.MTX</CODE> by default.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="folder-sort-rule"><EM>folder-sort-rule</EM></A>

<DD> This option controls the order in which folder list entries will be
presented in the FOLDER LIST screen.  Choose one of the following:

 <DL>
 <DT> <EM>Alphabetical</EM>

 <DD> sort by alphabetical name independent of type

 <DT> <EM>Alpha-with-dirs-last</EM>

 <DD> sort by alphabetical name grouping directory entries
to the end of the list

 <DT> <EM>Alpha-with-dirs-first</EM>

 <DD> sort by alphabetical name grouping directory entries
to the start of the list
 </DL>

The normal default is <EM>Alphabetical</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="font-name"><EM>font-name</EM></A>

<DD> Winsock version of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="font-size"><EM>font-size</EM></A>

<DD> Winsock version of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="font-style"><EM>font-style</EM></A>

<DD> Winsock version of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="forced-abook"><EM>forced-abook-entry</EM></A>

<DD> System-wide <EM>Pine</EM> configuration files only.
Force these address book
entries into all writable personal address books.
This is a list variable. Each item in the list has the form:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
   Nickname | Fullname | Address <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

with optional whitespace in all the obvious places.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="form-letter-folder"><EM>form-letter-folder</EM></A>

<DD> A Form Letter Folder is a mail folder that is intended to
contain messages that you have composed and that are intended to be
sent in their original form repeatedly.

<P>
Setting this variable will alter <EM>Pine</EM>'s usual behavior when you
execute the Compose command.  Normally, <EM>Pine</EM> offers a chance to
continue a postponed or interrupted message should one or the other
exist.  When this variable is set to a folder name that exists, <EM>Pine</EM>
will also offer the chance to select a message from the folder to
insert into the composer, much like when continuing a postponed message.
The difference, however, is that <EM>Pine</EM> will not automatically delete
the selected message from the Form Letter Folder.
<P>
Setting this variable will also affect <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when you
Postpone a message from the composer.  Normally, <EM>Pine</EM> simply stashes
the message away in your
<A HREF="#postponed-folder"><EM>Postponed-Folder</EM></A>.
Regardless of the specified folder's existence, <EM>Pine</EM> will ask which
folder you intend the message to be stored in.  Choose the
&quot;F&quot; option to store the message in your Form Letter Folder.
This is the most common way to add a message to the folder.

<P>
Another method of adding messages to the folder is via the <EM>Pine</EM>
composer's <SAMP>Fcc:</SAMP> field.  If you are sending a message that
you expect to send in the same form again, you can enter the Form
Letter Folder's name in this field.  <EM>Pine</EM>, as usual, will copy the
message as it's sent.  Note, when you later select this message from 
your Form Letter Folder, it will have the same recipients as the original
message.

<P>
To delete a message from the Form Letter Folder, you can either select
the folder from a suitable FOLDER LIST screen, or use the Delete
command in the MESSAGE INDEX offered when selecting from the folder as
part of the Compose command.  You can delete a Form Letter Folder just
as any other folder from a suitable FOLDER LIST screen.

<P>
You may find that the <A HREF="#role-config"><EM>Roles</EM></A>
facility introduced in <EM>Pine</EM> 4.10 can be used
to replace the Form Letter Folder.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="glob-abook"><EM>global-address-book</EM></A>

<DD> A list of shared address books.  Each entry in the list is an
optional nickname followed by a pathname or file name relative to the home
directory.
A SPACE character separates the nickname from the rest of the line.
Instead of a local pathname or file name, a remote folder name can be given.
This causes the address book to
be a <A HREF="low-level.html#addrbook"><EM>Remote address book</EM></A>.
Remote folder syntax is discussed in
<A HREF="config-notes.html#remote-folders">Syntax for Remote Folders</A>.
This list will be added to the
<A HREF="#pers-abook"><EM>address-book</EM></A> list to
arrive at the complete set of address books.  Global address books are
defined to be ReadOnly.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="goto-default-rule"><EM>goto-default-rule</EM></A>

<DD> This value affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when using
the <EM>Goto</EM> command.
There are five possible values for this option:
<P>

 <DL>

 <DT> <EM>folder-in-first-collection</EM>

 <DD> <EM>Pine</EM> will offer the most recently visited folder in the default
collection found in the &quot;Collection List&quot; screen as the default.
<P>
 
 <DT> <EM>inbox-or-folder-in-first-collection</EM>

 <DD> If the current folder is <EM>INBOX</EM>,
<EM>Pine</EM> will offer the most recently visited folder in the
default collection found in the &quot;Collection List&quot; screen.
If the current folder is other than <EM>INBOX</EM>,
<EM>INBOX</EM> is offered as the default.
<P>
 
 <DT> <EM>inbox-or-folder-in-recent-collection</EM>

 <DD> This is <EM>Pine</EM>'s default behavior.
If the current folder is <EM>INBOX</EM>,
<EM>Pine</EM> will offer the last open
folder as the default.
If the current folder is other than <EM>INBOX</EM>,
<EM>INBOX</EM> is offered as the default.
<P>
 
 <DT> <EM>first-collection-with-inbox-default</EM>

 <DD> Instead of offering the most recently visited folder in the default
collection, the default collection is offered but with <EM>INBOX</EM> as
the default folder.
If you type in a folder name it will be in the default collection.
If you simply accept the default, however, your <EM>INBOX</EM> will be opened.
<P>

 <DT> <EM>most-recent-folder</EM>

 <DD> The last accepted value simply causes the most recently opened
folder to be offered as the default regardless of the currently opened
folder.
<P>
 
 </DL>
 
NOTE: The default while a newsgroup is open remains the same; the last
open newsgroup. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="image-viewer"><EM>image-viewer</EM></A>

<DD> This variable names the program to call for displaying parts of a
MIME message that are of type IMAGE.  If your system supports the
<EM>mailcap</EM> system, you don't need to set this variable.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="inbox-path"><EM>inbox-path</EM></A>

<DD> This specifies the name of the folder to use for the <EM>INBOX</EM>.
By default this is unset and the system's default is used.
The most common reason for
setting this is to open an IMAP mailbox for the <EM>INBOX</EM>.  For example,
<EM>{imap5.u.example.edu}inbox</EM> will open the user's standard
<EM>INBOX</EM> on the mail server, <EM>imap5</EM>.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="incoming-archive-folders"><EM>incoming-archive-folders</EM></A>

<DD> This is like <A HREF="#read-msg-fold"><EM>read-message-folder</EM></A>,
only more general. This is a list
of folder pairs, with the first separated from the second in the pair by a
space.  The first folder in a pair is the folder you want to archive, and
the second folder is the folder that read messages from the first should
be moved to.  Depending on how you define the
<A HREF="#auto-read-msg"><EM>auto-move-read-msgs</EM></A>
feature, you may or may not be asked when you leave
the first folder if you want read messages to be moved to the second
folder. In either case, moving the messages means they will be deleted
from the first folder. <P>
 
If these are not path names, they will be in the default collection for
<EM>Save</EM>s.  Any valid folder specification, local or remote (via IMAP), is
allowed.  There is no default. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="inc-fold"><EM>incoming-folders</EM></A>

<DD> This is a list of one or more folders other than <EM>INBOX</EM> that
may receive new messages.  This list is slightly special in that it is
always expanded in the folder lister.  In the future, it may become more
special.  For example, it would be nice
if <EM>Pine</EM> would monitor the folders
in this list for new mail.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="incoming-startup-rule"><EM>incoming-startup-rule</EM></A>

<DD> This rule affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when opening
the <EM>INBOX</EM> or
another folder from the "INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS".
This rule tells <EM>Pine</EM>
which message to make the current message when an incoming folder is opened.
There are seven possible values for this option:
<P>

 <DL>

 <DT> <EM>first-unseen</EM>

 <DD> The current message will be the first unseen message which has not been
marked deleted, or the last message if all of the messages have been seen.
This is the default setting.
<P>
 
 <DT> <EM>first-recent</EM>

 <DD> This is similar to <EM>first-unseen</EM>. Instead of first unseen
it is the first recent message. A message is considered to be recent if it
arrived since the last time the folder was open (by any mail client, not just
the current one). So this option causes the
current message to be set to the first undeleted-recent message, or the
last message if none is both undeleted and recent.
<P>

 <DT> <EM>first-important</EM>

 <DD> This will result in the current message being set to the first
message marked Important (but not Deleted).
If no messages are marked Important, then it will be the last message.
<P>

 <DT> <EM>first-important-or-unseen</EM>

 <DD> This selects the minimum of the first unseen and the first important
messages.
<P>

 <DT> <EM>first-important-or-recent</EM>

 <DD> This selects the first of the first recent and the first important
messages.
<P>

 <DT> <EM>first</EM>

 <DD> Set the current message to the first undeleted message unless all
are deleted. In that case set it to the last message.
<P>
 
 <DT> <EM>last</EM>

 <DD> Set the current message to the last undeleted message unless all
are deleted. In that case set it to the last message.
<P>
 
 </DL>
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-answered-background-color"><EM>index-answered-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="index-answered-foreground-color"><EM>index-answered-foreground-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="index-deleted-background-color"><EM>index-deleted-background-color</EM></A>

<DT> <A NAME="index-to-me-background-color"><EM>index-to-me-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="index-to-me-foreground-color"><EM>index-to-me-foreground-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="index-unseen-background-color"><EM>index-unseen-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="index-unseen-foreground-color"><EM>index-unseen-foreground-color</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#index-colors"><EM>Index Colors</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-format"><EM>index-format</EM></A>

<DD> This option is used to customize the content of lines in the
MESSAGE INDEX screen.  Each line is intended 
to convey some amount of immediately relevant information about each 
message in the current folder.
<P>

<EM>Pine</EM> provides a pre-defined set of informational fields with
reasonable column widths automatically computed.  You can, however,
replace this default set by listing special tokens in the order you
want them displayed.
<P>

The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="#index-tokens"><EM>here</EM></A>.
<P>

Spaces are used to separate listed tokens.  Additionally, you can
specify how much of the screen's width the taken's associated data
should occupy on the index line by appending the token with a pair of
parentheses enclosing either a number or percentage.  For example,
&quot;SUBJECT(13)&quot; means to allocate 13 characters of space to the subject
column, and &quot;SUBJECT(20%)&quot; means to
allocate 20% of the available space
to the subjects column, while plain &quot;SUBJECT&quot; means the system will
attempt to figure out a reasonable amount of space.
<P>

There is always one space between every pair of columns, so if you use fixed
column widths (like 13) you should remember to take that into account.
Several of the fields are virtually fixed-width, so it doesn't make
much sense to specify the width for them.  The fields STATUS,
FULLSTATUS, IMAPSTATUS, MSGNO, the DATE fields, SIZE,
and DESCRIPSIZE all fall into that category.
You <EM>may</EM> specify widths for those if you wish, but
you're probably better off letting the system pick those widths.  <P>

<P>
The default is equivalent to:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>index-format=STATUS&nbsp;MSGNO&nbsp;DATE&nbsp;FROMORTO(33%)&nbsp;SIZE&nbsp;SUBJECT(67%)</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
This means that the four fields without percentages will be allocated
first, and then 33% and 67% of the <EM>remaining</EM> space will go to
the from and subject fields.  If one of those two fields is specified
as a percentage and the other is left for the system to choose, then
the percentage is taken as an absolute percentage of the screen, not
of the space remaining after allocating the first four columns.  It
doesn't usually make sense to do it that way.  If you leave off all
the widths, then the subject and from fields (if both are present) are
allocated space in a 2 to 1 ratio, which is almost exactly the same as
the default.

<P>
What you are most likely to do with this configuration option is to
specify which fields appear at all, which order they appear in, and the
percentage of screen that is used for the from and subject fields if you
don't like the 2 to 1 default.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="initial-keystroke-list"><EM>initial-keystroke-list</EM></A>

<DD> This is a comma-separated list of keystrokes which <EM>Pine</EM> executes on
startup.  Items in the list are usually just characters, but there are
some special values.  <EM>SPACE,</EM> <EM>TAB,</EM> and <EM>CR</EM> mean a
space character, tab character, and a carriage return, respectively. 
<EM>F1</EM> through <EM>F12</EM> stand for the twelve function keys. 
<EM>UP, DOWN, LEFT, </EM>and<EM> RIGHT </EM>stand for the arrow keys. 
Control characters are represented with <EM>^&lt;char&gt;</EM>.  A
restriction is that you can't mix function keys and character keys in this
list even though you can, in some cases, mix them when running <EM>Pine</EM>.  A
user can always use only <EM>character</EM> keys in the startup list even
if he or she is using <EM>function</EM> keys normally, or vice versa. If
an element in this list is a string surrounded by double quotes (")
then it will be expanded into the individual characters in the string,
excluding the double quotes. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="kblock-count"><EM>kblock-passwd-count</EM></A>

<DD> System-wide <EM>Pine</EM> configuration files only. Number of times a user
will have to enter a password when they run the keyboard lock command in
the main menu. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="keylabel-background-color"><EM>keylabel-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="keylabel-foreground-color"><EM>keylabel-foreground-color</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#keylabel-color"><EM>KeyLabel Color</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="keyname-background-color"><EM>keyname-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="keyname-foreground-color"><EM>keyname-foreground-color</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#keyname-color"><EM>KeyName Color</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="last-time"><EM>last-time-prune-questioned</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.  This variable records the month
the user was last asked if his or her <EM>sent-mail</EM> folders should
be pruned. 
The format is <EM>yy.mm</EM>.
This is automatically updated by <EM>Pine</EM> when
the the pruning is done or declined.
If a user wanted to make <EM>Pine</EM> stop
asking this question he or she could set this time to something
far in the future.
This may not be set in the system-wide configuration files.
Note: The <EM>yy</EM> year is actually the number of years since 1900, so it
will be equal to 101 in the year 2001.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="last-version-used"><EM>last-version-used</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.
This is set automatically by <EM>Pine</EM>. 
It is used to keep track of the last version of <EM>Pine</EM> that
was run by the user.
Whenever the version number increases, a new version message is printed out.
This may not be set in the system-wide configuration files.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="ldap-servers"><EM>ldap-servers</EM></A>

<DD> This is only available if <EM>Pine</EM> was linked with an LDAP library
when it was compiled. This variable is normally managed by <EM>Pine</EM> though
it can be set in the system-wide configuration files as well as the personal
configuration. It is a list variable. Each item in the
list contains quite a bit of extra information besides just the server name.
To put this into a system-wide config file the easiest thing to do is to
configure a personal <EM>Pine</EM> for the LDAP server then copy the
configuration line
into the system-wide config file. Each item in the list looks like:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     <CODE>
     server_name[:port] <SPACE> "quoted stuff" </CODE><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The <CODE>server_name</CODE> is just a hostname and it is followed by
an optional colon and port number. The default <CODE>port</CODE> is 389.
Following the server name is a single SPACE character followed by
a bunch of characters inside double quotes. The part inside the quotes is
a set of <EM>tag</EM> = <EM>value</EM> pairs.
Each tag is preceded by a slash (/) and followed
by an equal sign. The value for that tag is the text up to the next slash.
An example of some <CODE>quoted stuff</CODE> is:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     <CODE>
     "/base=o=University of Washington, c=US/impl=0/.../nick=My Server"
     </CODE><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This would set the search base for this server to
<CODE>o=University of Washington, c=US</CODE>, set the implicit bit to zero,
and set the nickname for the server to <CODE>My Server</CODE>.
All of the tags correspond directly to items in the Setup/Directory screen
so experiment with that if you want to see what the possible tags and values
are.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="literal-signature"><EM>literal-signature</EM></A>

<DD> With this option your actual signature, as opposed to
the name of a file containing your signature,
is stored in the <EM>Pine</EM> configuration file.
If this is defined it takes precedence over the <EM>signature-file</EM> option.
<P>

This is simply a different way to store the signature data.
The signature is stored inside your <EM>Pine</EM> configuration file
instead of in a separate signature file.
Tokens contained in the signature work the same way they do with the regular
<A HREF="#sig-file">signature-file</A>.
<P>

The Setup/Signature command in <EM>Pine</EM>'s Main Menu will edit
the <EM>literal-signature</EM> by default.  However, if no
<EM>literal-signature</EM> is defined and the file named in the
<EM>signature-file</EM> option exists, then the latter will be used
instead.  Compose (Reply, Forward, ...) will default to using the
<EM>literal-signature</EM> if defined, otherwise it will use the contents
of the file named in <EM>signature-file</EM>.
<P>

The <EM>Pine</EM> composer is used to edit the literal-signature.
The result of that edit is first converted to a C-style string before it
is stored in the configuration file.
In particular, the two character sequence &#92;n (backslash followed by
the character &quot;n&quot;) will be used to signify a
line-break in the signature.
You don't have to enter the &#92;n, but it will be visible in the
SETUP CONFIGURATION window after you are done editing the signature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="mail-check"><EM>mail-check-interval</EM></A>

<DD> This option specifies, in seconds, how often <EM>Pine</EM> will check for new
mail. If set to zero, new-mail checking is disabled. There is a minimum
value, normally 15 seconds.
<P>
There are some situations where new-mail checking does not work.
For example, if a mail folder is opened using the POP protocol or a newsgroup
is being read using the NNTP protocol, then new-mail checking is disabled.
<P>
It may be possible to check for new mail in these cases by reopening the
folder.
There is an experimental method for doing this.
You reopen by going back to the folder list screen from the message
index screen with the &quot;&lt;&quot; command,
and then going back into the message index screen with
the &quot;&gt;&quot; command.
If <EM>Pine</EM> knows that reopening the folder would be a way to discover
new mail, it offers to do the reopen.
If you don't agree to reopen (you answer No) then you are just back in
the message index with no change.
However, if you agree to reopen the folder by answering Yes,
the folder is closed and then reopened.
In this case, the current state of the open folder is lost.
The New status, Important and Answered flags,
selected state, Zoom state, collapsed or expanded state of threads,
current message number,
and any other temporary state is all lost when the reopen happens.
For POP folders (but not NNTP newsgroups) the Deleted flags are also lost.
<P>
A side effect of disabling mail checking is that there will be situations
in which the user's IMAP connection will be broken due to inactivity timers
on the server. Another side effect is that the
<A HREF="#user-input"><EM>user-input-timeout</EM></A>
option won't work.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="mail-directory"><EM>mail-directory</EM></A>

<DD> This variable was more important in previous versions of <EM>Pine</EM>.  Now
it is used only as the default for storing personal folders (and only if
there are no <A HREF="#fold-coll"><EM>folder-collections</EM></A> defined).
The default value is
<EM>~/mail</EM> on UNIX and <EM>$HOME\MAIL</EM> on a PC.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="mailcap-search-path"><EM>mailcap-search-path</EM></A>

<DD> This variable is used to replace <EM>Pine</EM>'s default
mailcap file search path.
It takes one or more file names (full paths must be specified) in
which to look for mail capability data.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="mimetype-search-path"><EM>mimetype-search-path</EM></A>

<DD> This variable is used to replace <EM>Pine</EM>'s default mime.types file
search path.  It takes one or more file names (full paths must be
specified) in which to look for file-name-extension to MIME type mapping
data.  See the Config Notes for details on <EM>Pine</EM>'s usage of the <A
HREF="config-notes.html#mime.types">MIME.Types File</A>.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="new-version-threshold"><EM>new-version-threshold</EM></A>

<DD> When a new version of <EM>Pine</EM> is run for the first time it offers a
special explanatory screen to the user upon startup.  This option
helps control when and if that special screen appears for users that
have previously run <EM>Pine</EM>.  It takes as its value a <EM>Pine</EM> version
number.  <EM>Pine</EM> versions less than the specified value will supress this
special screen while versions equal to or greater than that specified
will behave normally. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-active"><EM>news-active-file-path</EM></A>

<DD> This option tells <EM>Pine</EM> where to look for the "active file" for
newsgroups when accessing news locally, rather than via NNTP.  The default
path is usually <CODE>/usr/lib/news/active</CODE>. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-coll"><EM>news-collections</EM></A>

<DD> This is a list of collections where news folders are located.  See
the section describing <A HREF="config-notes.html#collections">collections</A>
for more information.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-spool"><EM>news-spool-directory</EM></A>

<DD> This option tells <EM>Pine</EM> where to look for the "news spool" for
newsgroups when accessing news locally, rather than via NNTP.  The default
path is usually <CODE>/usr/spool/news</CODE>. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="newsrc-path"><EM>newsrc-path</EM></A>

<DD> This option overrides the default name <EM>Pine</EM> uses for your "newsrc" 
news status and subscription file.  If set, <EM>Pine</EM> will take this value as
the full pathname for the desired newsrc file. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="nntp-server"><EM>nntp-server</EM></A>

<DD> One or more NNTP servers (host name or IP address) which <EM>Pine</EM> will
use for reading and sending news.
If you read and post news to and from a single
NNTP server, you can get away with only setting the <EM>nntp-server</EM>
variable and leaving the <EM>news-collections</EM> variable unset.  <P>

<DD> System-wide <EM>Pine</EM> configuration files only.
This names the root of the
tree to which the user is restricted when reading and writing folders and
files. It is usually used in the <EM>fixed</EM> configuration file. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="patterns-filters"><EM>patterns-filters</EM></A>

<DD> Matching patterns and their corresponding actions are stored in
this variable.
These patterns are used with
<A HREF="#filter-config"><EM>Filtering</EM></A>.
This variable is normally maintained through the Setup/Rules/Filters
configuration screen.
It is a list variable.
Each member of the list is a single pattern/action pair, or it can be
a file which contains zero or more lines of pattern/action pairs.
The only way to create a filters file is to use the InsertFile command in
the Setup/Rules/Filters screen with a filename which doesn't yet exist.
Then use the Shuffle command to move existing filter patterns into the file.
This isn't very convenient but it isn't thought that many users will
need this functionality.
The purpose of filter files is for sharing filters.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="personal-name"><EM>personal-name</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.
User's full personal name.  On UNIX systems, the default is taken
from the accounts data base (<CODE>/etc/passwd</CODE>).  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="personal-print-category"><EM>personal-print-category</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.
This is the category that the default print command belongs to. There
are three categories. Category 1 is an attached printer which uses the ANSI
escape sequence, category 2 is the standard system print command, and
category 3 is the set of custom printer commands defined by the user.
This just helps <EM>Pine</EM> figure out where to put the cursor when the user
runs the <EM>Setup/Printer</EM> command. This is not used by <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="personal-print-command"><EM>personal-print-command</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.
This corresponds to the third category in the printer menu, the
personally selected print commands. This variable
contains the list of custom commands that the user has entered in the
<EM>Setup/Printer</EM> screen. This is not used by <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="postponed-folder"><EM>postponed-folder</EM></A>

<DD> The folder where postponed messages are stored.  The default is
<EM>postponed-msgs</EM> (Unix) or <EM>POSTPOND</EM> (PC).  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="print-font-name"><EM>print-font-name</EM></A>

<DD> Winsock version of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="printer"><EM>printer</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.
This is the current setting for a user's printer.

<DD> <A HREF="#prompt-color"><EM>Prompt Color</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="pruned-folders"><EM>pruned-folders</EM></A>

<DD> This variable allows you to define a list of one or more folders that
<EM>Pine</EM> will offer to prune for you in the same way
it automatically offers
to prune your <EM>sent-mail</EM> folder each month.
That is, once a month for
each folder listed, <EM>Pine</EM> will offer to move the contents
of the folder to
a new folder of the same name but with the previous month's date appended. 
<EM>Pine</EM> will then look for any such date-appended folder
names created for a
previous month, and offer each one it finds for deletion. If you decline
the first offer, no mail is moved and no new folder is created. Folders
listed are assumed to exist, and the archive folders will be created, in
the first collection defined by the
<A HREF="#fold-coll"><EM>folder-collections</EM></A> variable. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="pruning-rule"><EM>pruning-rule</EM></A>

<DD> By default, <EM>Pine</EM> will ask at the beginning of each month whether or not
you want to rename your sent-mail folder to a name like sent-mail-month-year.
It will also ask whether you would like to delete old sent-mail folders.
If you have defined
<A HREF="#read-msg-fold"><EM>read-message-folder</EM></A>
or
<A HREF="#pruned-folders"><EM>pruned-folders</EM></A>
<EM>Pine</EM> will also ask about pruning those folders.
With this option you may provide an automatic answer to the rename questions
and you may tell <EM>Pine</EM> to not ask about deleting old folders.<P>

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="read-msg-fold"><EM>read-message-folder</EM></A>

<DD> If set, mail in the <EM>INBOX</EM> that has been read but not deleted
is moved here, or rather, the user is asked whether or not he or she wants
to move it here upon quitting <EM>Pine</EM>.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="remote-abook-history"><EM>remote-abook-history</EM></A>

<DD> Sets how many extra copies of
<A HREF="low-level.html#addrbook">remote address book</A>
data will be kept in each remote address book folder.
The default is three.
These extra copies are simply old versions of the data. Each time a change
is made a new copy of the address book data is appended to the folder. Old
copies are trimmed, if possible, when <EM>Pine</EM> exits.
An old copy can be put back into use by
deleting and expunging newer versions of the data from the folder.
Don't delete the first message from the folder. It is a special header
message for the remote address book and it must be there.
This is to prevent regular folders from being used as remote address book
folders and having their data destroyed.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="remote-abook-metafile"><EM>remote-abook-metafile</EM></A>

<DD> Personal configuration file only.
This is usually set by <EM>Pine</EM> and is the name of a file
that contains data about
<A HREF="low-level.html#addrbook">remote address books</A> and
<A HREF="low-level.html#remote-config">remote configuration files</A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="remote-abook-validity"><EM>remote-abook-validity</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the minimum number of minutes that a
remote address book will be considered up to date.
Whenever an entry contained in a remote address book is used,
if more than this many minutes have
passed since the last check the remote server will be queried to see if the
address book has changed.
If it has changed, the local copy is updated.
The default value is five minutes.
The special value of -1 means never check.
The special value of zero means only check when the address book is first
opened.
<P>
No matter what the value, the validity check is always done when the
address book is about to be changed by the user.
The check can be initiated manually by typing <EM>^L</EM> (control-L)
while in the address book maintenance screen for the remote address book.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="reply-ind-str"><EM>reply-indent-string</EM></A>

<DD> This variable specifies an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s <EM>Reply</EM>
command.
When a message is replied to and the text of the message is included, the
included text usually has the string &quot;&gt; &quot; prepended
to each line indicating it is quoted text.
 
<P>
This option specifies a different value for that string.
If you wish to use a string which begins or ends with a space,
enclose the string in double quotes.
 
<P>
Besides simple text, the prepended string can be based
on the message being replied to.
The following tokens are substituted for the message's corresponding value:

<DL>
<DT>_FROM_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the message sender's &quot;username&quot;.
At most six characters are used.
</DD>

<DT>_NICK_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the nickname of the message sender's
address as found in your addressbook.
If no addressbook entry is found,
Pine replaces the characters &quot;_NICK_&quot; with nothing.
At most six characters are used.
</DD>

<DT>_INIT_</DT>
<DD>This token gets replaced with the initials of the sender of the message.
</DD>

</DL>

When the
<A HREF="#enable-reply-indent-string-editing"><EM>enable-reply-indent-string-editing</EM></A>
feature is enabled, you are given the opportunity to edit the string, whether 
it is the default or one automatically generated using the above tokens.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="reply-leadin"><EM>reply-leadin</EM></A>

<DD> This variable specifies an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s <EM>Reply</EM>
command.
When a message is replied to and the text of the message is included,
that text has an introductory line preceding it.
The normal default if you don't set this variable looks something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On Sat, 24 Oct 1998, Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where the day of the week is only included if it is available in the
original message.
You may replace this default with text of your own.
The text may contain tokens which are replaced with text
which depends on the message you are replying to.
For example, the default is equivalent to:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>On _DAYDATE_, _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="#index-tokens"><EM>here</EM></A>.
<P>
For the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="#reply-token-conditionals"><EM>here</EM></A>.

<P>

If your <EM>Reply-Leadin</EM> turns out to be longer
than 80 characters when replying to a particular message, it is shortened.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token
in the introduction line you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#92;_DAYDATE_ = _DAYDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DAYDATE_ = Sat, 24 Oct 1998</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
 
<DT> <A NAME="reverse-background-color"><EM>reverse-background-color</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#reverse-color"><EM>Reverse Color</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="rsh-command"><EM>rsh-command</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the format of the command used to
open a UNIX remote shell connection. The default is
"%s %s -l %s exec /etc/r%sd". All four "%s" entries MUST exist in the
provided command. The first is for the command's pathname, the second is
for the host to connnect to, the third is for the user to connect as, and
the fourth is for the connection method (typically <CODE>imap</CODE>).
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="rsh-open-timeout"><EM>rsh-open-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the time in seconds that <EM>Pine</EM> will
attempt to open a UNIX remote shell connection.
The default is 15, the minimum non-zero value is 5,
and the maximum is unlimited. If this is set to zero rsh connections
will be completely disabled.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="rsh-path"><EM>rsh-path</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the name of the command used to open a UNIX remote shell
connection. The default is typically <CODE>/usr/ucb/rsh</CODE>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="saved-msg-name"><EM>saved-msg-name-rule</EM></A>

<DD> Determines default folder name when <EM>Sav</EM>ing.
If set to <EM>default-folder</EM> (which is the default setting),
then <EM>Pine</EM> will offer the folder "saved-messages" (UNIX) or "SAVEMAIL" 
(PC) for <EM>Sav</EM>ing messages. The default folder offered in this way
may be changed by using the configuration variable
<A HREF="#def-save"><EM>default-saved-msg-folder</EM></A>.
<P>

If this rule is set to <EM>last-folder-used</EM>, <EM>Pine</EM> offers to
<EM>Save</EM> to the folder you last successfully <EM>Saved</EM> a message
to (this session).
The first time you <EM>Save</EM> a message in a session,
<EM>Pine</EM> offers to <EM>Save</EM> the message to the default folder.
<P>

Choosing any of the <EM>by-</EM> options causes <EM>Pine</EM> to attempt
to get the chosen option's value for the message being <EM>Saved</EM>.
For example, if <EM>by-from</EM> is chosen, <EM>Pine</EM> attempts to
get the value of who the message
came from (i.e. the from address). <EM>Pine</EM> then attempts to
<EM>Save</EM> the message to a folder matching that value.
If <EM>by-from</EM> is chosen and no value is
obtained, <EM>Pine</EM> uses <EM>by-sender</EM>.
The opposite is also true.
If <EM>by-recipient</EM> was chosen and the message was posted to a newsgroup,
<EM>Pine</EM> will use the newsgroup name. 
If <EM>by-replyto</EM> is chosen and no value is
obtained, <EM>Pine</EM> uses <EM>by-from</EM>.
<P>
 
If any of the &quot;by-realname&quot; options are chosen, <EM>Pine</EM> will attempt
to use the personal name part of the address instead of the mailbox part.
If any of the &quot;by-nick&quot; options are chosen, the
address is looked up in your address book and if found, the
nickname for that entry is used.
Only simple address book entries are checked, not distribution lists.
Similarly, if any of the
&quot;by-fcc&quot; options are chosen, the fcc from the corresponding
address book entry is used.
If by-realname, or the by-nick or by-fcc lookups result in no value,
then if the chosen option ends with the &quot;then-from&quot;,
&quot;then-sender&quot;, &quot;then-replyto&quot;,
or &quot;then-recip&quot; suffix, <EM>Pine</EM>
reverts to the same behavior as &quot;by-from&quot;,
&quot;by-sender&quot;, &quot;by-replyto&quot;, or &quot;by-recip&quot;
depending on which option was specified.
If the chosen option doesn't end with one of
the &quot;then-&quot; suffixes, then <EM>Pine</EM> reverts to the default
folder when no match is found in the address book.

<P>
Here is an example to make some of the options clearer.
If the message is From
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Fred Flintstone &lt;flint@bedrock.org&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
and this rule is set to &quot;by-from&quot;, then the default folder offered
in the save dialog would be &quot;flint&quot;.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-realname-of-from&quot; then the default would
be &quot;Fred Flintstone&quot;.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-nick-of-from&quot; then <EM>Pine</EM> will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has a nickname associated with it, that nickname
will be offered as the default folder.
If not, the default saved message folder will be offered as the default.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-fcc-of-from&quot; then <EM>Pine</EM> will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has an Fcc associated with it, that Fcc
will be offered as the default folder.
If not, the default saved message folder will be offered as the default.
<P>
If this rule is set to &quot;by-nick-of-from-then-from&quot; then <EM>Pine</EM> will search
for the address &quot;flint@bedrock.org&quot; in your address book.
If an entry is found and it has a nickname associated with it, that nickname
will be offered as the default folder.
If it is not found (or has no nickname) then the default offered will be
the same as it would be for the &quot;by-from&quot; rule.
That is, it would be &quot;flint&quot;
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="scroll-margin"><EM>scroll-margin</EM></A>

<DD> This option controls when <EM>Pine</EM>'s line-by-line scrolling occurs.
Typically, when a selected item is at the top or bottom screen edge
and the UP or DOWN (and Ctrl-P or Ctrl-N) keys are pressed, the
displayed items are scrolled down or up by a single line.
<P>
 
This option allows you to tell <EM>Pine</EM> the number of lines from the top and
bottom screen edge that line-by-line scrolling should occur. For example,
setting this value to one (1) will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to scroll the display
when you move to select an item on the display's top or
bottom edge (instead of moving when you move off the edge of the screen).
<P>
  
By default, this variable is zero (0), indicating that scrolling happens
when you move up or down to select an item immediately off the display's
top or bottom edge.

<DT> <A NAME="sending-filters"><EM>sending-filters</EM></A>

<DD> This option defines a list of text-filtering commands (programs and
scripts) that may be selectively invoked to process a message just before
it is sent.  If set, the Composer's <EM>^X Send</EM> command will allow you to
select which filter (or none) to apply to the message before it is sent. 
For security reasons, the full path of the filter program must be
specified.
<P>
Sending filters do not work with <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>
Command Modifying Tokens:

<DL>
<DT><EM>_RECIPIENTS_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is replaced 
with the space delimited list of recipients of the 
message being sent. 
        
<DT><EM>_TMPFILE_</EM>
<DD>
When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of the temporary 
file containing the text to be filtered.  <EM>Pine</EM> 
expects the filter to replace this data with the 
filter's result.

NOTE: Use of this token implies that the text to 
be filtered is not piped into standard input of the 
executed command and its standard output is ignored. 
<EM>Pine</EM> restores the tty modes before invoking the
filter in case the filter interacts with the user
via its own standard input and output.  
                        
<DT><EM>_RESULTFILE_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is 
replaced with the path and name of a temporary 
file intended to contain a status message from the 
filter. <EM>Pine</EM> displays this in the message status 
field. 
 
<DT><EM>_DATAFILE_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is replaced 
in the command line with the path and name of a 
temporary file that <EM>Pine</EM> creates once per session 
and deletes upon exit.  The file is intended to be 
used by the filter to store state information between 
instances of the filter.
   
<DT><EM>_PREPENDKEY_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token indicates 
that a random number will be passed down the input 
stream before the message text. It is not included as a command-line argument.
This number could be used as a session key.  It is sent in this way 
to improve security.  The number is unique to the 
current <EM>Pine</EM> session and is only generated once per 
session. 

<DT><EM>_INCLUDEALLHDRS_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token indicates 
that the headers of the message will be passed down the input stream
before the message text.
It is not included as a command-line argument.
The filter should, of course, remove the headers before returning control
to <EM>Pine</EM>.

<DT><EM>_MIMETYPE_</EM>
<DD>When the command is executed, this token is replaced in the
command name with a temporary file name used to accept any new MIME
Content-Type information necessitated by the output of the filter.
Upon the filter's exit, if the file contains new MIME type
information, <EM>Pine</EM> verifies its format and replaces the outgoing
message's MIME type information with that contained in the file. This
is basically a cheap way of sending something other than Text/Plain.
</DL>
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="sendmail-path"><EM>sendmail-path</EM></A>

<DD> This names the path to an
alternative program, and any necessary arguments, to be used in posting
mail messages.  See the section on <A
HREF="background.html#SMTP">SMTP and Sendmail</A> for more details.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="sig-file"><EM>signature-file</EM></A></A>

<DD> This is the name of a file which will be automatically inserted into
outgoing messages.
It typically contains information such as your
name, email address and organizational affiliation.
<EM>Pine</EM> adds the
signature into the message as soon as you enter the composer so you
can choose to remove it or edit it on a message by message basis.
Signature file placement in message replies is controlled by the
<A HREF="#sig-at-bot">signature-at-bottom</A>
setting in the feature list.
<P>

This defaults to
<CODE>~/.signature</CODE> on UNIX and &lt;PINERC
directory&gt;<CODE>\PINE.SIG</CODE> on a PC.  <P>

To create or edit your signature file choose Setup from the Main Menu
and then select S for Signature (Main/Setup/Signature).
This puts you
into the Signature Editor where you can enter a <EM>few</EM> lines of
text containing your identity and affiliation.

<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program which will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from <EM>Pine</EM>,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.

<P>
Instead of storing the data in a local file, the
signature data may be stored remotely in an IMAP folder.
In order to do this, 
you must use a remote name for the file.
A remote signature-file name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/signature</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or, if you have an SSL-capable version of <EM>Pine</EM>, you might try
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us/user=loginname/ssl}mail/signature</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

The syntax used here is the same as the syntax used for remote configuration
files from the command line.
Note that you may not access an existing signature file remotely,
you have to create a new <EM>folder</EM> which contains the signature data.
If the name you use here for the signature file is a remote name, then when
you edit the file from the Setup/Signature command the data will be stored
remotely in the folder.
You aren't required to do anything special to create the folder, it
gets created automatically if you use a remote name.

<P>
Besides regular text, the signature file may also contain
(or a signature program may produce) tokens which
are replaced with text which usually depends on the message you are replying
to or forwarding.
For example, if the signature file contains the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
anywhere in the text, then that token is replaced by the date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
If it contains
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_CURDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
that is replaced with the current date.
The first is an example of a token which depends on the message you
are replying to (or forwarding) and the second is an example which
doesn't depend on anything other than the current date.
You have to be a little careful with this facility since tokens which
depend on the message you are replying to or forwarding will be replaced
by nothing in the case where you are composing a new message from scratch.
The use of <A HREF="#role-config"><EM>roles</EM></A> may help you
in this respect.
It allows you to use different signature files in different cases.
<P>

The list of tokens available for use in the signature file is
<A HREF="#index-tokens"><EM>here</EM></A>.
<P>

Instead of, or along with the use of <EM>roles</EM> to give you
different signature files in different situations, there is also
a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
This is explained in detail
<A HREF="#reply-token-conditionals"><EM>here</EM></A>.
This isn't for the faint of heart.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token
in the signature you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example,
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>&#92;_DAYDATE_ = _DAYDATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would produce something like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DAYDATE_ = Sat, 24 Oct 1998</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="smtp-server"><EM>smtp-server</EM></A>

<DD> One or more SMTP servers (host name or IP address) which <EM>Pine</EM> will
use for outgoing mail.  If not set, <EM>Pine</EM> passes outgoing email to the
<EM>sendmail</EM> program on the local machine.  <EM>PC-Pine</EM> users must have
this variable set in order to send mail as they have no <EM>sendmail</EM>
program.
<P>
If the SMTP server offers SMTP AUTH authentication you may specify a
user name parameter to cause <EM>Pine</EM> to attempt to authenticate.
This parameter requires an associated value,
the username identifier with which to establish the server
connection.
An example might be:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com/user=katie</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

If AUTH authentication is offered by the server, this will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to
attempt to use it.
If AUTH authentication is not offered by the server, this will cause <EM>Pine</EM>
to fail sending with an error similar to:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Error: SMTP authentication not available</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>

To use a non-standard port number on the SMTP server, follow the hostname
with colon portnumber.

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>smtpserver.example.com:12345</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
See the <A
HREF="config-notes.html#smtp-server">SMTP Servers</A> section for
some more details.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="sort-key"><EM>sort-key</EM></A>

<DD> This variable sets up the default Message Index sorting.
The default is to
sort by arrival order (the order the messages arrived in the folder).
It has the same functionality as the
<EM>-sort</EM> command line argument and the <EM>$</EM> command in the
"Folder Index".  If a <EM>sort-key</EM> is set, then all folders open during
the session will have that as the default sort order.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="speller"><EM>speller</EM></A>

<DD> This option affects the behavior of the <EM>^T</EM> (spell check)
command in the Composer.
It specifies the program invoked by <EM>^T</EM> in the Composer.
By default, <EM>Pine</EM> uses the system's "spell" command.
<EM>Pine</EM> will use the
command defined by this option (if any) instead.
When invoking the spell-checking program,
<EM>Pine</EM> appends a tempfile name (where the message is passed)
to the command line.
<EM>Pine</EM> expects the speller to correct the
spelling in that file. When you exit from the speller
program <EM>Pine</EM> will read the
tmpfile back into the composer.
<P>
For Unix <EM>Pine</EM> the program <EM>ispell</EM> works well as an
alternate spell checker.
If your Unix system has <EM>ispell</EM> it is probably reasonable to make
it the default speller by configuring it as the default in the
system configuration file, <CODE>/usr/local/lib/pine.conf</CODE>.

<P>
If this option is not set, then the system's <EM>spell</EM> command is used.
The spell command does not work the same as the alternate speller.
It produces a list of misspelled words on its standard output, instead,
and doesn't take a tempfile as an argument.
Don't set this speller option to the standard Unix spell command.
That won't work. If you want to use the standard Unix spell command,
set the speller option to nothing.

<DT> <A NAME="ssh-command"><EM>ssh-command</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the format of the command used to
open a UNIX secure shell connection. The default is
"%s %s -l %s exec /etc/r%sd". All four "%s" entries MUST exist in the
provided command. The first is for the command's pathname, the second is
for the host to connnect to, the third is for the user to connect as, and
the fourth is for the connection method (typically <CODE>imap</CODE>).
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="ssh-open-timeout"><EM>ssh-open-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the time in seconds that <EM>Pine</EM> will
attempt to open a UNIX secure shell connection.
The default is 15, the minimum non-zero value is 5,
and the maximum is unlimited. If this is set to zero ssh connections
will be completely disabled.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="ssh-path"><EM>ssh-path</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the name of the command used to open a UNIX secure shell
connection. The default is typically <CODE>/usr/local/bin/ssh</CODE>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="standard-printer"><EM>standard-printer</EM></A>

<DD> System-wide configuration file only. Specifies a list of commands
for category 2 of the <EM>Setup/Printer</EM> screen, the standard print command
section. This is not used by <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="status-background-color"><EM>status-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="status-foreground-color"><EM>status-foreground-color</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#status-color"><EM>Status Color</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="status-message-delay"><EM>status-message-delay</EM></A>

<DD> If this is set to a positive number, it causes the cursor to move to
the status line whenever a status message is printed and pause there for
this many seconds. It will probably only be useful if the
<A HREF="#show-cursor"><EM>show-cursor</EM></A>
feature is also turned on. Most users should leave this set to the
default value of zero since its only effect is to slow things down.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="tcp-open-timeout"><EM>tcp-open-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the time in seconds that <EM>Pine</EM> will
attempt to open a network connection. The default is 30, the minimum is 5,
and the maximum is system defined (typically 75). If a connection has not
completed within this many seconds <EM>Pine</EM> will give up and consider it a
failed connection.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="tcp-query-timeout"><EM>tcp-query-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> When <EM>Pine</EM> times out a network read or write it will normally just display
a message saying &quot;Still waiting&quot;.
However, if enough time has elapsed since it started waiting it will offer
to let you break the connection.
That amount of time is set by this option, which defaults to 60 seconds,
has a minimum of 5 seconds, and a maximum of 1000 seconds.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="tcp-read-warning-timeout"><EM>tcp-read-warning-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the time in seconds that <EM>Pine</EM> will
wait for a network read before warning you that things are moving slowly
and possibly giving you the option to break the connection.
The default is 15 seconds. The minimum is 5 seconds and the maximumn is
1000 seconds.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="threading-display-style"><EM>threading-display-style</EM></A>

<DD> When a folder is sorted by Threads or OrderedSubject,
this option will affect the MESSAGE INDEX display.
By default, <EM>Pine</EM> will display the MESSAGE INDEX in the
&quot;show-thread-structure&quot; style if a folder is sorted
by Threads or OrderedSubject.
The possible values are:
<P>

<DL>
<DT><EM>none</EM></DT>
<DD>Regular index display.
The same index line as would be displayed without threading is used.
The only difference will be in the order of the messages.
</DD>

<DT><EM>show-thread-structure</EM></DT>
<DD>Threaded Subjects will be indented and vertical bars and horizontal
lines will be added to make it easier to see the relationships among
the messages in a thread (a conversation).
</DD>

<DT><EM>mutt-like</EM></DT>
<DD>This is the same as the option above except that the Subject
is suppressed (is blank) if it matches the previous Subject in the thread.
The name comes from the email client <A HREF="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</A>.
</DD>

<DT><EM>indent-subject-1</EM></DT>
<DD>Threaded Subjects will be indented one space per level of the conversation.
The bars and lines that show up in the show-thread-structure display will
not be there with this style.
</DD>

<DT><EM>indent-subject-2</EM></DT>
<DD>Same as above but indent two spaces per level instead of one space.
</DD>

<DT><EM>indent-from-1</EM></DT>
<DD>Similar to indent-subject-1, except that instead of indenting the
Subject field one space the From field of a thread will be indented one
space per level of the conversation.
</DD>

<DT><EM>indent-from-2</EM></DT>
<DD>Same as above but indent two spaces per level instead of one space.
</DD>

<DT><EM>show-structure-in-from</EM></DT>
<DD>The structure of the thread is illustrated with indenting, vertical bars,
and horizontal lines just like with the show-thread-structure option, but
the From field is used to show the relationships instead of the Subject field. 
</DD>

</DL>
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="threading-expanded-character"><EM>threading-expanded-character</EM></A>

<DD> The Threading-Expanded-Character option has a small effect on the MESSAGE
INDEX display when using a
<A HREF="#threading-display-style"><EM>threading-display-style</EM></A>
other than <EM>none</EM>.
The value of this option is a single character.
This character is used to indicate that part of a thread has been expanded
and could be collapsed if desired with
the &quot;/&quot; Collapse/Expand command.
By default, the value of this option is a dot (.).
<P>
If this option is set to the Empty Value, then the column (and the following
blank column) will be deleted from the display.
<P>
This option is closely related to the
<A HREF="#threading-indicator-character"><EM>threading-indicator-character</EM></A>
option.
Another similar option which affects the thread display is the
<A HREF="#threading-lastreply-character"><EM>threading-lastreply-character</EM></A> option.

<DT> <A NAME="threading-index-style"><EM>threading-index-style</EM></A>

<DD> When a folder is sorted by Threads or OrderedSubject,
this option will affect the INDEX displays.
The possible values are:
<P>

<DL>
<DT><EM>regular-index-with-expanded-threads</EM></DT>
<DD>This is the default display.
If the configuration option
<A HREF="#threading-display-style"><EM>threading-display-style</EM></A>
is set to something other than &quot;none&quot;, then this setting
will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to start off with a MESSAGE INDEX with all of
the threads expanded.
That is, each message will have a line in the MESSAGE INDEX display.
The Collapse/Expand command (/) may be used to manually collapse or
expand a thread or subthread (see also <A HREF="#slash-collapses-entire-thread"><EM>slash-collapses-entire-thread</EM></A>).
<P>
This setting affects the display when the folder is first threaded.
The collapsed state may also be re-initialized by re-sorting the folder manually
using the SortIndex command ($).
After re-sorting the threads will once again all be expanded, even if you
have previously collapsed some of them.
<P>
If &quot;threading-display-style&quot; is set to &quot;none&quot;, then
the display will be the regular default Pine MESSAGE INDEX, but sorted
in a different order.
</DD>

<DT><EM>regular-index-with-collapsed-threads</EM></DT>
<DD>If the configuration option
<A HREF="#threading-display-style"><EM>threading-display-style</EM></A>
is set to something other than &quot;none&quot;, then this setting
will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to start out with all of the threads collapsed instead of
starting out with all of the threads expanded.
The Collapse/Expand command (/) may be used to manually collapse or
expand a thread or subthread (see also <A HREF="#slash-collapses-entire-thread"><EM>slash-collapses-entire-thread</EM></A>).
<P>
This setting affects the display when the folder is first threaded.
The collapsed state may also be re-initialized by re-sorting the folder manually
using the SortIndex command ($).
After re-sorting the threads will once again all be collapsed, even if you
have previously expanded some of them.
</DD>

<DT><EM>separate-index-screen-always</EM></DT>
<DD>With this setting and the next, you will see an index of threads
instead of an
index of messages, provided you have sorted by Threads or OrderedSubject.
<P>
The THREAD INDEX contains a '*' in the first column if any message in the thread
is marked Important.
If not, it contains a '+' if any message in the thread is to you.
The second column is blank. The third column contains a 'D' if all of the
messages in the thread are deleted.
Otherwise, it contains an 'N' if any of the messages in the thread are New.
<P>
When you view a particular thread from the THREAD INDEX you will be
in the MESSAGE INDEX display
but the index will only contain messages from the thread you are viewing.
</DD>

<DT><EM>separate-index-screen-except-for-single-messages</EM></DT>
<DD>This is very similar to the option above.
When you are in the THREAD INDEX, one of the available commands
is &quot;ViewThd&quot;.
With the setting &quot;separate-index-screen-always&quot; (the option above)
when you view a particular thread you will be in the
MESSAGE INDEX display and the index will only contain messages from
the thread you are viewing.
If the thread you are viewing consists of a single message, the MESSAGE INDEX
will be an index with only one message in it.
If you use this &quot;separate-index-screen-except-for-single-messages&quot;
setting instead, then that index which contains a single message
will be skipped and you will go directly from the THREAD INDEX into the
MESSAGE VIEW screen.
</DD>

</DL>

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="threading-indicator-character"><EM>threading-indicator-character</EM></A>

<DD> The Threading-Indicator-Character option has a small effect on the MESSAGE
INDEX display when using a
<A HREF="#threading-display-style"><EM>threading-display-style</EM></A>
other than <EM>none</EM> and sorting by Threads or OrderedSubject.
The value of this option is a single character.
This character is used to indicate that part of a thread (a conversation) is
hidden beneath a message.
The message could be expanded
if desired with the &quot;/&quot; Collapse/Expand command.
By default, the value of this option is the greater than sign (&gt;).
<P>
If this option is set to the Empty Value, then the column (and the following
blank column) will be deleted from the display.

<P>
This option is closely related to the
<A HREF="#threading-expanded-character"><EM>threading-expanded-character</EM></A>
option.
Another similar option which affects the thread display is the
<A HREF="#threading-lastreply-character"><EM>threading-lastreply-character</EM></A> option.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="threading-lastreply-character"><EM>threading-lastreply-character</EM></A>

<DD>The Threading-Lastreply-Character option has a small effect on the MESSAGE
INDEX display when using a
<A HREF="#threading-display-style"><EM>threading-display-style</EM></A>
of <EM>show-thread-structure</EM>, <EM>mutt-like</EM>, or
<EM>show-structure-in-from</EM>; and sorting by Threads or OrderedSubject.
The value of this option is a single character.
This character is used instead of the vertical line character when there are
no more replies directly to the parent of the current message.
It can be used to &quot;round-off&quot; the bottom of the vertical line
by setting it to a character such as a backslash.
By default, the value of this option is the vertical bar character (|).
This option may not be set to the Empty Value.
In that case, the default will be used instead.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="tcp-write-warning-timeout"><EM>tcp-write-warning-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the time in seconds that <EM>Pine</EM> will
wait for a network write before warning you that things are moving slowly
and possibly giving you the option to break the connection.
The default is 0 which means it is unset. If set to a non-zero value, the
minimum is 5 and the maximum is 1000.

<DT> <A NAME="title-background-color"><EM>title-background-color</EM></A>
<DT> <A NAME="title-foreground-color"><EM>title-foreground-color</EM></A>

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="titlebar-color-style"><EM>titlebar-color-style</EM></A>

<DD> <A HREF="#titlebar-style"><EM>titlebar-color-style</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="upload-command"><EM>upload-command</EM></A>

<DD> This option affects the behavior of the Composer's <EM>^R</EM> (Read File)
and <EM>^J</EM> (Attach File, in the header) commands.  It
specifies a Unix program name, and any necessary command line arguments,
that <EM>Pine</EM> can use to transfer files from your personal computer into
messages that you are composing. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="upload-command-prefix"><EM>upload-command-prefix</EM></A>

<DD> This option is used in
conjunction with the <EM>upload-command</EM> option. 
It defines text to be written to the terminal emulator (via standard
output) immediately prior to starting the upload command. This is useful for
integrated serial line file transfer agents that permit command passing
(e.g., Kermit's APC method). <P>

<DT> <A NAME="url-viewers"><EM>url-viewers</EM></A>

<DD> List of programs to use to open Internet URLs.
This value affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s handling of URLs that are found in the text of
messages you read. Normally, only URLs <EM>Pine</EM> can handle directly are
automatically offered for selection in the "Message Text" screen. When
one or more comma delimited Web browsers capable of deciphering URLs on
their command line are added here, <EM>Pine</EM> will choose the first available
browser to display URLs it doesn't recognize.
<P>

Additionally, to support various connection methods and browsers, each
entry in this list can begin with the special token
<CODE>_TEST(test-string)_</CODE>.
The <CODE>test-string</CODE> is a shell command that <EM>Pine</EM>
will run and which must exit with a status of zero for <EM>Pine</EM> to consider
that browser for use (the other criteria is that the browser must exist
as a full path or a path relative to your home directory).
<P>

Now for an example:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
    <CODE>
    url-viewers=_TEST("test -n '$&#123;DISPLAY}'")_  /usr/local/bin/netscape,
		/usr/local/bin/lynx,
		C:&#92;BIN&#92;NETSCAPE.BAT </CODE><BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

This example shows that for the first browser in the list to be used the
environment variable <CODE>DISPLAY</CODE> must be defined.
If it is, then the file <CODE>/usr/local/bin/netscape</CODE> must exist.
If either condition is not met, then the file
<CODE>/usr/local/bin/lynx</CODE> must exist.
If it doesn't, then the final path and file must
exist. Note that the last entry is a DOS/Windows path. This is one way
to support <EM>Pine</EM> running on more than one architecture with the same
configuration file.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="use-only"><EM>use-only-domain-name</EM></A>

<DD> Can be set to <EM>yes</EM> or <EM>no.</EM> Anything but
<EM>yes</EM> means <EM>no.</EM> If set to <EM>yes</EM> the first label in
the host name will be lopped off to get the domain name and the domain
name will be used for outgoing mail and such.  That is, if the host name
is <EM>carson.u.example.edu</EM> and this variable is set to <EM>yes,</EM>
then <EM>u.example.edu</EM> will be used on outgoing mail.  Only
meaningful if <A HREF="#user-domain"><EM>user-domain</EM></A> is NOT set.  <P>

<DT> <A NAME="user-domain"><EM>user-domain</EM></A>

<DD> Sets the domain or host name for the user, overriding the system host
or domain name.  See the <A HREF="config-notes.html#domain"><EM>domain name section</EM></A>. <P>

<DT> <A NAME="user-id"><EM>user-id</EM></A>

<DD> <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only and personal configuration file only.
Sets the username that is placed on all outgoing
messages. The username is the part of the address that comes before the "@".
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="user-input"><EM>user-input-timeout</EM></A>

<DD> If this is set to an integer greater than zero, then this is the number
of <EM>hours</EM> to wait for user input before <EM>Pine</EM> times out.
If <EM>Pine</EM> is
in the midst of composing a message or is waiting for user response to
a question, then it will not timeout.
However, if <EM>Pine</EM> is sitting idle waiting for
the user to tell it what to do next and the user does not give any
input for this many hours, <EM>Pine</EM> will exit.
No expunging or moving of read
messages will take place.
It will exit similarly to the way it would exit
if it received a hangup signal.
This may be useful for cleaning up unused <EM>Pine</EM> sessions which have been
forgotten by their owners.
The <EM>Pine</EM> developers envision system administrators
setting this to a value of several hours (24?) so that it won't surprise
a user who didn't want to be disconnected.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="viewer-hdr-colors"><EM>viewer-hdr-colors</EM></A>

<DD> This variable holds the optional Header Colors and patterns which
have been defined by the user. This is usually modified by using
the <A HREF="#header-colors"><EM>Header Colors</EM></A> section
of the Setup Color screen.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="viewer-hdrs"><EM>viewer-hdrs</EM></A>

<DD> You may change the default list of headers that are viewed by listing
the headers you want to view here.  If the headers in your <EM>viewer-hdrs</EM> 
list are present in the message, then they will be shown.  The order of
the headers you list will also be honored. If the special
value <EM>all-except</EM> 
is included as the first header in the <EM>viewer-hdrs</EM> list, then all
headers in the message except those in the list will be shown. The values
are all case insensitive.<P>
 
<DT> <A NAME="overlap"><EM>viewer-overlap</EM></A>

<DD> This option specifies an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s Message Viewing screen. 
When the space bar is used to page forward in a message, the number of
lines specified by the <EM>viewer-overlap</EM> variable
will be repeated from the
bottom of the screen.  That is, if this was set to two lines, then the
bottom two lines of the screen would be repeated on the top of the next
screen. The normal default value is "2". <P>

<DT> <A NAME="window-position"><EM>window-position</EM></A>

<DD> Winsock version of <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.  Window position in the format: 
CxR+X+Yn Where C and R are the window size in characters and X and Y are
the screen position of the top left corner of the window.  <P>

<HR>

<H2><A NAME="features-conf">Configuration Features</A></H2>

There are several features (options) which may be turned off or on.
The configuration variable
<A HREF="#feat-list"><EM>feature-list</EM></A> is a list of all the
features that are turned on or off.
If the name of a feature is in
the list it will be turned on.
If the name of a feature with the characters
<CODE>no-</CODE> prepended is in the list, it will turn the feature off.
This is useful for overriding system-wide defaults.
This is because, unlike all the other configuration variables,
the <EM>feature-list</EM> is additive.
That is, first the system-wide <EM>feature-list</EM> is read
and then the user's <EM>feature-list</EM> is read. This makes it possible
for the system manager to turn some of the features on by default while
still allowing the user to cancel that default.
For example, if the system manager has
turned on the <EM>allow-talk</EM> feature by default then a user may turn
it back off by including the feature <EM>no-allow-talk</EM> in his or her
personal configuration file. Of course, these details are usually handled
by <EM>Pine</EM> when the user turns an option on or off from inside the
<EM>Setup/Config</EM> screen.
<P>

System managers should take some care when turning on features by default.
Some of the documentation assumes that all of the features are off by
default, so it could be confusing for a user if some are on by default instead.
<P>

Here is an alphabetical list of possible features. 

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> <A NAME="allow-from"><EM>allow-changing-from</EM></A>

<DD> Prior to <EM>Pine</EM> 4.00 there was a <EM>compile</EM>-time option called
ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM. That has been replaced by a <EM>runtime</EM> feature.
If this feature is turned on then the From line can be changed just like
all the other header fields that can be changed. See the configuration
variables <A HREF="#cust-hdr"><EM>customized-hdrs</EM></A>
and <A HREF="#def-comp"><EM>default-composer-hdrs</EM></A>
for more information on editing headers.
<P>
Beginning with <EM>Pine</EM> 4.30 the default value for this feature has
been changed from OFF to ON, so that editing of From headers is now allowed
by default.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="allow-talk"><EM>allow-talk</EM></A>

<DD> Unix <EM>Pine</EM> only. By default, permission for
others to <EM>talk</EM> to your terminal is turned
off when you are running <EM>Pine</EM>.  When this feature is set, permission is
instead turned on.
<P>

Note: The <EM>talk</EM> program has nothing to do with <EM>Pine</EM> or email.  The 
<EM>talk</EM> daemon on your system will
attempt to print a message on your screen 
when someone else is trying to contact you.  If you wish to see these
messages while you are running <EM>Pine</EM>, you should enable this feature.
<P>
 
If you do enable this feature and see a <EM>talk</EM> message, you must 
suspend or quit <EM>Pine</EM> before you can respond.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="alternate-compose-menu"><EM>alternate-compose-menu</EM></A>

<DD>This feature controls the menu that is displayed when Compose is selected.
If set, a list of options will be presented, with each option representing
the type of composition that could be used. This feature is most useful for
users who want to avoid being prompted with each option separately, or who
want to avoid the checking of remote postponed or form letter folders.
The possible types of composition are:

<P>
New, for starting a new composition. Note that if New is selected and roles
are set, roles are checked for matches and applied according to the setting
of the matching role.

<P>
Interrupted, for continuing an interrupted composition. This option is only
offered if an interrupted message folder is detected.

<P>
Postponed, for continuing postponed compositions. This option is offered
if a postponed-folder is set in the config <EM>REGARDLESS OF</EM> whether or not
the postponed folder actually exists. This option is especially handy
for avoiding having to check for the existence of a remote postponed folder.

<P>
Form, for using form letters. This option is offered if the form-letter-folder
is set in the config, and is not checked for existence for reasons similar
to those explained by the postponed option.

<P>
setRole, for selecting a role to apply to a composition.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="assume-slow-link"><EM>assume-slow-link</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s display routines.  If set, the normal
inverse-video cursor (used to highlight the current item in a list) will be
replaced by an <EM>arrow</EM> cursor and other screen update optimizations for
low-speed links (e.g. 2400 bps dialup connections) will be activated.
This might be useful if <I>you</I> know you have a slow speed link but for some
reason <EM>Pine</EM> doesn't know.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="auto-read-msg"><EM>auto-move-read-msgs</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect
of <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior upon quitting.  If set,
and the <A HREF="#read-msg-fold"><EM>read-message-folder</EM></A>
variable is also set, then <EM>Pine</EM> will
automatically transfer all read messages from the <EM>INBOX</EM> to
the designated folder and mark
them as deleted in the <EM>INBOX</EM>.  Messages in the <EM>INBOX</EM> marked
with an <EM>N</EM> (meaning New, or unseen) are not affected.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="auto-open-next-unread"><EM>auto-open-next-unread</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls the behavior of the TAB key when traversing folders
in the optional <A HREF="#inc-fold"><EM>incoming-folders</EM></A>
collection or in optional <A HREF="#news-coll"><EM>news-collections</EM></A>.
<P>

When the TAB (Next New) key is pressed, and there are no more unseen
messages in the current (incoming message or news) folder, <EM>Pine</EM> will
search the list of folders in the current collection for one containing
New or Recent (new since the last time the folder was opened) messages.
By default, when such a folder is found,
<EM>Pine</EM> will ask whether you wish to
open the folder.
If this feature is set, <EM>Pine</EM> will automatically open the
folder without prompting.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="auto-unzoom-after-apply"><EM>auto-unzoom-after-apply</EM></A>

<DD> If set, and if
you are currently looking at a Zoomed Index view of selected messages,
the <EM>Apply</EM> command will do the operation you specify, but then will
implicitly do an <EM>UnZoom</EM>, so that you will automatically be back in
the normal Index view after the <EM>Apply</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="auto-zoom-after-select"><EM>auto-zoom-after-select</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the <EM>; select</EM> command will automatically
perform a <EM>Zoom</EM> after the <EM>select</EM> is complete.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="check-newmail-when-quitting"><EM>check-newmail-when-quitting</EM></A>

<DD> If set, <EM>Pine</EM> will check for new mail after you give the
Quit command.
If new mail has arrived since the previous check, you will be notified
and given the choice of quitting or not quitting.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="combined-addrbook-display"><EM>combined-addrbook-display</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects the address book display screens.
Normally, expanding an address book from the ADDRESS BOOK LIST screen
will cause the remaining address books and directory servers to disappear
from the screen, leaving only the entries of the expanded address book.
If this feature is set, then the other address books will remain on the screen,
so that all of the address books can be present at once.

<P>
The way that commands work won't be changed.
For example, the Select All command will select all of the entries in the
current address book, not all of the entries in all of the address books.
The WhereIs command will change a little.
It will search through all of the text on the screen plus all of the entries
from expanded address books.

<P>
When this feature is set, the setting of the feature
<A HREF="#expanded-view-of-addressbooks"><EM>expanded-view-of-addressbooks</EM></A>
has an effect.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="combined-folder-display"><EM>combined-folder-display</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects the folder list display screens.
Normally, each folder list is viewed within its collection only.  This
command allows folder lists to be viewed within a single screen that
combines the contents of all collections.

<P>
The way that commands work won't be changed.
For example, the Select All command will select all of the folders in the
current collection, not all of the entries in all of the collections.
The WhereIs command will change a little.
It will search through all of the folders in the current collection as well
as all the folder in any other expanded collection.

<P>
When this feature is set, the setting of the feature
<A HREF="#expanded-view-of-folders"><EM>expanded-view-of-folders</EM></A>
has an effect.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="combined-subdirectory-display"><EM>combined-subdirectory-display</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects the Folder List screen when
the
<A HREF="#combined-folder-display"><EM>combined-folder-display</EM></A>
feature is enabled.  Normally, selecting a directory from the Folder
List takes you into a new screen displaying only the contents of
that directory.

<P>
Enabling this feature will cause the contents of the selected
directory to be
displayed within the boundaries of the
<A HREF="background.html#collections"><EM>Collection</EM></A>
it is a part of.  All previously displayed collections will remain
in the screen.

<P>
The way that commands work won't be changed.
For example, the Select All command will select all of the folders in the
directory, as opposed to all of the entries in all of the collections.
The WhereIs command will change a little.
It will search through all of the folders in the current collection as well
as all the folder in any other expanded collection.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="compose-cut-from-cursor"><EM>compose-cut-from-cursor</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the <EM>^K</EM> command in the composer will cut from the
current cursor position to the end of the line,
rather than cutting the entire line.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="compose-maps-delete-key-to-ctrl-d"><EM>compose-maps-delete-key-to-ctrl-d</EM></A>

<DD> If set, Delete will be equivalent to ^D, and delete
the current character. Normally <EM>Pine</EM> defines the Delete key
to be equivalent to ^H, which deletes the <EM>previous</EM>
character.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs"><EM>compose-rejects-unqualified-addrs</EM></A>

<DD> If set, unqualified names entered as addresses will be treated as errors
unless they match an addressbook nickname or are looked up successfully
on an LDAP server. <EM>Pine</EM> will not attempt to turn
them into complete addresses by adding your local domain (which <EM>Pine</EM> normally
does by default).
<P>

A complete (fully-qualified) address is one containing a username
followed by an <EM>@</EM> symbol, followed by a host or domain name (e.g.
<EM>jsmith@nowhere.edu</EM>). An unqualified name is one without the
<EM>@</EM> symbol
and host or domain name (e.g. <EM>jsmith</EM>).
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="compose-send-offers-first-filter"><EM>compose-send-offers-first-filter</EM></A>

<DD> If you have <A HREF="#sending-filters"><EM>sending-filters</EM></A>
configured, setting this feature will cause the first filter in the
<EM>sending-filters</EM> list to be offered as the default
instead of <EM>unfiltered</EM>, the usual default.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="compose-sets-newsgroup-without-confirm"><EM>compose-sets-newsgroup-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> If you enter the
composer while reading a newsgroup, you will normally be prompted to
determine whether you intend the new message to be posted to the current
newsgroup or not.  If this feature is set, <EM>Pine</EM> will not prompt you
in this situation, and will assume that you do indeed wish to post
to the newsgroup you are reading.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="confirm-role-even-for-default"><EM>confirm-role-even-for-default</EM></A>

<DD> If you have roles, when you Reply to or Forward a message, or Compose
a new message, <EM>Pine</EM>
will search through your roles for one which matches.
Normally, if no matches are found you will be placed into the composer
with no opportunity to select a role.
If this feature is set, then you will be asked to confirm that you don't
want a role.
This will give you the opportunity to select a role (with the ^T command).
If you confirm no role with a Return, you will be placed in
the composer with no role.
You may also confirm with either an &quot;N&quot; or a &quot;Y&quot;.
These behave the same as if you pressed the Return.
(The &quot;N&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; answers are available because they
match what you might type if there was a role match.)
<P>
If you are using the alternate form of the Compose command called
&quot;Role&quot;, then all of your roles will be available to you,
independent of the value of this feauture and of the values set for all of
Reply Use, Forward Use, and Compose Use.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="continue-tab-without-confirm"><EM>continue-tab-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, when you use the TAB NextNew
command and there is a problem checking a folder, you are asked
whether you want to continue with the search in the following folder or not.
This gives you a chance to stop the NextNew processing.
<P>
If this feature is set you will not be asked.
It will be assumed that you want to continue.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="delete-skips-deleted"><EM>delete-skips-deleted</EM></A>

<DD> If set, this
feature will cause the <EM>Delete</EM> command to
advance past other messages that
are marked deleted.  In other words, pressing <EM>D</EM> will both mark the
current message deleted and advance to the next message that is not marked
deleted.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-2022-jp-conversions"><EM>disable-2022-jp-conversions</EM></A>

<DD> By default, UNIX <EM>Pine</EM> will convert ISO-2022-JP data into EUC
and <EM>PC-Pine</EM>
will convert ISO-2022-JP data into Shift-JIS before displaying it.
Conversely, when sending mail UNIX <EM>Pine</EM> will convert EUC into ISO-2022-JP
and <EM>PC-Pine</EM> will convert Shift-JIS into ISO-2022-JP.
If this feature is set, those conversions are turned off.
<P>
Most of <EM>Pine</EM> is not set up to handle multi-byte characters or variable width characters.
From time to time, your display will be garbled because <EM>Pine</EM>'s word wrapping
code, which is not aware of the possibility that characters may be
multi-byte, may wrap a line in the middle of a character.
<EM>Pico</EM> is also not able to edit Japanese data so you will need to use an
<A HREF="#enable-alt-ed"><EM>alternate editor</EM></A>
when composing or replying to mail.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-busy-alarm"><EM>disable-busy-alarm</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the spinning bar that sometimes appears in the status line will not
appear when <EM>Pine</EM> is busy. This might be useful if it is suspected that
the alarm(2) system calls that <EM>Pine</EM> uses to implement the busy spinner
are suspected of causing a problem.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-charset-conversions"><EM>disable-charset-conversions</EM></A>

<DD> By default, if your
&quot;character-set&quot; configuration option
is different from the character set
of the message you are viewing, then <EM>Pine</EM> will
attempt to convert the characters to the character set you have set
in the &quot;character-set&quot; configuration option before
sending them to your display.
This does not work for multi-byte or variable width character sets.
<P>
If this feature is set, the conversions are turned off.
<P>
Conversion is only possible if the character being converted is present in
both character sets.
Many pairs of character sets have no characters in common.
In that case, <EM>Pine</EM> will not attempt any conversion.
If there are some characters in common then <EM>Pine</EM> will attempt to convert
those and will display the unknown characters as question marks.
<P>
Japanese character set conversions are controlled separately with the
<A HREF="#disable-2022-jp-conversions"><EM>disable-2022-jp-conversions</EM></A>
feature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-config-cmd"><EM>disable-config-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the configuration
screen <EM>Setup/Config</EM> will not be available at all.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-kblock"><EM>disable-keyboard-lock-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> In the Main <EM>Pine</EM> menu there is a Keyboard locking
command (<EM>KBLock</EM>). If this feature is set, that command won't be
available to the user.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-keymenu"><EM>disable-keymenu</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the command key menu that normally appears on the
bottom two lines of the screen will not usually be there. Asking for
help with <EM>^G</EM> or <EM>?</EM> will cause the key menu to
appear instead of causing the help message to come up. If you want to
actually see the help text,
another <EM>^G</EM> or <EM>?</EM> will show it to you.
After the key menu has popped
up with the help key it will remain there for an <EM>O Other</EM> command but
will disappear if any other command is typed.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-password-caching"><EM>disable-password-caching</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, loginname/password combinations are cached in <EM>Pine</EM>
so that the user does not have to enter the same password more than once
in a session.
A disadvantage to this approach is that the password must be stored in
the memory image of the running <EM>Pine</EM> in order that it can be reused.
In the event that <EM>Pine</EM> crashes and produces a core dump, and that core
dump is readable by others, the loginname and password could possibly be read
from the core dump.
<P>
If this hidden feature is set, then the passwords will not be cached and
the user will have to retype the password whenever <EM>Pine</EM> needs it.
Even with this feature set there is still some chance that the core
file will contain a password, so care should be taken to make the
core files unreadable.
<P>
NOTE: If PASSFILE caching is enabled, this does not disable it.
That is a separate and independent feature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-password-cmd"><EM>disable-password-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> If set the <EM>Newpassword</EM> command usually available under the
<EM>Setup</EM> command will not be available.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-pipes-in-sigs"><EM>disable-pipes-in-sigs</EM></A>

<DD> If set it will be an error to append a vertical bar (|) to the name
of a signature file.
Appending a vertical bar normally causes the signature file to be executed
to produce the signature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-pipes-in-templates"><EM>disable-pipes-in-templates</EM></A>

<DD> If set it will be an error to append a vertical bar (|) to the name
of a template file.
Appending a vertical bar normally causes the signature file to be executed
to produce the signature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-roles-setup-cmd"><EM>disable-roles-setup-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> If set the <EM>Roles</EM> command usually available under the
<EM>Setup</EM> command will not be available.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-roles-sig-edit"><EM>disable-roles-sig-edit</EM></A>

<DD> If set the roles editor in the <EM>Setup/Roles</EM> command will not allow
editing of signature files with the F subcommand.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-roles-template-edit"><EM>disable-roles-template-edit</EM></A>

<DD> If set the roles editor in the <EM>Setup/Roles</EM> command will not allow
editing of template files with the F subcommand.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-sender"><EM>disable-sender</EM></A>

<DD> If set, <EM>Pine</EM> will not generate a &quot;Sender:&quot; or &quot;X-X-Sender&quot; header.
This may be desirable on a system which is virtually hosting many domains,
and the sysadmin has other methods available for tracking a message to
its originator.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-shared-namespaces"><EM>disable-shared-namespaces</EM></A>

<DD> If this hidden feature is set
the automatic search for namespaces &quot;ftp&quot;,
&quot;imapshared&quot;, and &quot;imappublic&quot; by the underlying library
will be disabled.
The reason this feature exists is because there are some implementations
of system password lookup routines which are very slow when presented with
a long loginname which does not exist.
This feature could be set to prevent the delay at startup time when the
names above are searched for in the password file.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-signature-edit-cmd"><EM>disable-signature-edit-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> If set the <EM>Signature</EM> editing command usually available under the
<EM>Setup</EM> command will not be available.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="disable-take-last-comma-first"><EM>disable-take-last-comma-first</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, when <EM>TakeAddr</EM> is used to copy an address
from a message into an address book, <EM>Pine</EM> will attempt to rewrite the
full name of the address in the form:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Last, First <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
	 
instead of
	  
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	First Last <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
		  
It does this because many people find it useful to sort by Last name instead
of First name. If this feature is set, then the <EM>TakeAddr</EM> command will
not attempt to reverse the name in this manner.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation"><EM>enable-8bit-esmtp-negotiation</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when sending mail.  Internet standards
require that all electronic mail messages traversing the global Internet
consist of 7bit ASCII characters unless a pair of cooperating mail 
transfer agents explicitly agree to allow 8bit messages.  In general, 
then, exchanging messages in non-ASCII characters requires MIME encoding.
<P>
 
However, there are now Internet standards that allow for unencoded 8bit
exchange of messages between cooperating systems.  Setting this feature
tells <EM>Pine</EM> to try to negotiate unencoded 8bit transmission during the
sending process.  Should the negotiation fail, <EM>Pine</EM> will fall back to its
ordinary encoding rules. 
<P>

Note, this feature relies on your system's mail transport agent or
configured <A HREF="#smtp-server"><EM>smtp-server</EM></A>
having the negotiation mechanism introduced in
"Extended SMTP" (ESMTP) and the specific extension called <EM>8BITMIME</EM>. 
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-8bit-nntp-posting"><EM>enable-8bit-nntp-posting</EM></A>

<DD> The Internet standard for exchanging USENET news messages (RFC-1036)
specifies that USENET messages should conform to Internet mail standards
and contain only 7bit characters, but much of the news transport software
in use today is capable of successfully sending messages containing 8bit
characters.  Hence, many people believe that it is appropriate to send 8bit
news messages without any MIME encoding.
<P>

Moreover, there is no Internet standard for explicitly negotiating 8bit
transfer, as there is for Internet email.  Therefore, <EM>Pine</EM> provides the
option of posting unencoded 8bit news messages, though not as the default.
Setting this feature will turn OFF <EM>Pine</EM>'s MIME encoding of newsgroup
postings that contain 8bit characters. 
<P>

Note, articles may cross a path or pass through news transport software
that is unsafe or even hostile to 8bit characters.  At best this will only
cause the posting to become garbled.  The safest way to transmit 8bit
characters is to leave <EM>Pine</EM>'s MIME encoding turned on, but recipients
who lack MIME-aware tools are often annoyed when they receive MIME-encoded 
messages.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-aggregate-command-set"><EM>enable-aggregate-command-set</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this feature enables the commands and subcommands that relate to
performing operations on more than one message at a time.
We call these "aggregate operations".
In particular, the <EM>; Select</EM>, <EM>A Apply</EM>, and
<EM>Z Zoom</EM> commands are enabled by this feature.
<EM>Select</EM> is used to <EM>tag</EM> one
or more messages meeting the specified criteria. <EM>Apply</EM> can then be used
to apply any message command to all of the selected/tagged messages.
Further, the <EM>Zoom</EM> command allows you to toggle the "Folder Index" view
between just those Selected and all messages in the folder.
<P>

This feature also enables the <EM>^X</EM> subcommand in
the "Folder Index" <EM>WhereIs</EM>
command which causes
all messages matching the <EM>WhereIs</EM> argument to become
selected.
<P>

You may also use aggregate operations in the address book screens where
you are operating on address book entries instead of on messages.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-alt-ed"><EM>enable-alternate-editor-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> If this feature is set, and the <A HREF="#editor"><EM>editor</EM></A>
variable is not set, entering
the <EM>^_</EM> (Control-underscore) key while
composing a message will prompt you
for the name of the editor you would like to use.
<P>
 
If the environment variable <CODE>$EDITOR</CODE> is set,
this value will be offered as a default.
  
If the <EM>editor</EM> variable is set, the <EM>^_</EM> key will activate
the specified editor without prompting, in which case it is not necessary to
set the <EM>enable-alternate-editor-cmd</EM> feature.
This feature is not available in <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-alt-imp"><EM>enable-alternate-editor-implicitly</EM></A>

<DD> If this feature and the <A HREF="#editor"><EM>editor</EM></A>
variable are both set, <EM>Pine</EM> will
automatically activate the specified editor when the cursor is moved from
the header of the message being composed into the message text.  For
replies, the alternate editor will be activated immediately.  If this
feature is set but the <EM>editor</EM> variable is not set,
then <EM>Pine</EM> will
automatically ask for the name of an alternate editor when the cursor
is moved out of the headers, or if a reply is being done.
This feature is not available in <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-arrow-navigation"><EM>enable-arrow-navigation</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls the behavior of the left and right arrow keys.
If set, the left and right arrow keys will operate like the usual
navigation keys <EM>&lt;</EM> and <EM>&gt;</EM>.

<P>
If you set this feature, and do not like the changed behavior of the up/down 
arrow keys when navigating through the FOLDER LIST screen -- 
<B>first</B> from column to column, if more than one folder is 
displayed per row, 
and <B>then</B> from row to row -- you may either also wish to set the feature 
<A HREF="#enable-arrow-navigation-relaxed"><EM>enable-arrow-navigation-relaxed</EM></A>, 
<A HREF="#single-column-folder-list"><EM>single-column-folder-list</EM></A>,
or use the ^P/^N (instead of up/down arrow) keys to move up/down the list of 
folders in each column.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-arrow-navigation-relaxed"><EM>enable-arrow-navigation-relaxed</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls the behavior of the left and right arrow keys
in the FOLDER LIST screen when the 
<A HREF="#enable-arrow-navigation"><EM>enable-arrow-navigation</EM></A>
feature is enabled.
<P>

Normally, when the &quot;enable-arrow-navigation&quot; feature is set,
the left and
right arrow keys in the Folder List screen strictly track the commands
bound to the <EM>&lt;</EM> and <EM>&gt;</EM> keys,
and the up and down arrow keys move the
hilite bar to the previous and next folder or directory name.
<P>

When enabled, this feature returns the left, right, up and down arrow
key's functionality in the FOLDER LIST screen to what it was before
enabling &quot;enable-arrow-navigation&quot;.
In other words, left and right arrows
move the hilite bar to the left or right, and the up and down arrows
move it up or down.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-background-sending"><EM>enable-background-sending</EM></A>

<DD> If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's <EM>Send?</EM> confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell <EM>Pine</EM> to handle the actual
posting in the background.  While this feature usually allows posting
to appear to happen very fast, it has no affect on the actual delivery
time it takes a message to arrive at its destination.
<P>

This feature isn't supported on all systems.  All DOS and Windows,
as well as several Unix ports, do not recognize this feature.
<P>

Error handling is significantly different when this feature is
enabled.  Any message posting failure results in the message
being appended to your <EM>Interrupted</EM> mail folder.  When you
type the <EM>Compose</EM> command, <EM>Pine</EM> will notice this folder and
offer to extract any messages contained.  Upon continuing a 
failed message, <EM>Pine</EM> will display the nature of the failure 
in the status message line.
<P>

Under extreme conditions, it is possible for message data to
get lost.  Do not enable this feature if you typically run close
to any sort of disk-space limits or quotas.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-bounce-cmd"><EM>enable-bounce-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this feature enables the <EM>B Bounce</EM> command,
which will prompt
for an address and <EM>remail</EM> the message to the new recipient.
This command
is used to re-direct messages that you have received in error, or need to
be redirected for some other reason (e.g. list moderation).  The final
recipient will see a header indicating that you have Resent the msg, but
the message's From: header will show the original author of the message,
and replies to it will go back to that author, and not to you.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-cruise-mode"><EM>enable-cruise-mode</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when you hit the "Space Bar" at
the end of a displayed message.  Typically, <EM>Pine</EM> complains that the end
of the text has already been reached.  Setting this feature causes such
keystrokes to be interpreted as if the <EM>Tab</EM> key had been hit, thus
taking you to the next <EM>interesting</EM> message, or scanning ahead to the 
next incoming folder with <EM>interesting</EM> messages.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-cruise-mode-delete"><EM>enable-cruise-mode-delete</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the behavior of <EM>Pine</EM>'s <EM>enable-cruise-mode</EM>
feature. Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to implicitly delete read
messages when it moves on to display the next <EM>interesting</EM> message.
<P>

NOTE: Beware when enabling this feature <B>and</B> the
<A HREF="#expunge-wo-confirm"><EM>expunge-without-confirm</EM></A> feature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-delivery-status-notification"><EM>enable-delivery-status-notification</EM></A>

<DD> If set, this
feature enables a subcommand in the composer's "Send?" confirmation
prompt.  The subcommand allows you to tell <EM>Pine</EM> to request the type of
Delivery Status Notification (DSN) which you would like.  Most users will
be happy with the default, and need not enable this feature. See the online
help for more details.
<P>

Note that this is not a method to request <EM>READ</EM> receipts, which tells
the sender when the receiver has read the message. In this case we're talking
about notification of delivery to the mailbox, not notification that the
message has been seen.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-dot-files"><EM>enable-dot-files</EM></A>

<DD> If set, files beginning with dot (".") will be
visible in the file browser.  For example, you'll be able to select them
when using the browser to add an attachment to a message.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-dot-folders"><EM>enable-dot-folders</EM></A>

<DD> If set, folders beginning with dot (".") may be added
and viewed.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-exit-via-lessthan-command"><EM>enable-exit-via-lessthan-command</EM></A>

<DD> If set, then on screens where there is an <EM>Exit</EM> command
but no <EM>&lt;</EM> command, the <EM>&lt;</EM> key will perform
the same function as the <EM>Exit</EM> command.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-fast-recent-test"><EM>enable-fast-recent-test</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the TAB key behavior in Incoming folders or News collections
is modified. By default, the TAB will cause each folder in the Incoming
folders collection (or in the news collection) to be examined to see how
many new messages have been delivered since the last time it was viewed.
If this feature is set, the check is for any recent messages instead of
the count of recent messages. This is much faster in many cases.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-flag-cmd"><EM>enable-flag-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this feature enables the <EM>* Flag</EM> command,
which allows you to
manipulate the status flags associated with a message.
By default, <EM>Flag</EM>
will set the <EM>Important</EM> flag, which results in an asterisk being
displayed in column one of the "Folder Index" for such messages.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-flag-screen-implicitly"><EM>enable-flag-screen-implicitly</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the behavior of the <EM>* Flag</EM> command
(provided it too is enabled).
By default, when the <EM>* Flag</EM> command is selected,
<EM>Pine</EM> offers a prompt to set one of several flags and also offers the
option of entering the detailed flag manipulation screen via the <EM>^T</EM>
key. Enabling this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to immediately enter the detailed
flag screen rather than first offer the simple prompt.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-full-header-cmd"><EM>enable-full-header-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> This feature enables the <EM>H Full Headers</EM> command which
toggles between
the display of all headers in the message and the normal edited view of
headers. The <EM>Full Header</EM> command also controls
which headers are included
for <EM>Export</EM>, <EM>Pipe</EM>, <EM>Print</EM>, <EM>Forward</EM>,
and <EM>Reply</EM> functions. (For <EM>Reply</EM>, the
<EM>Full Header</EM> mode will respect
the <EM>include-headers-in-reply</EM> feature setting.)
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-full-header-and-text"><EM>enable-full-header-and-text</EM></A>

<DD>
<P>This feature affects how the <EM>H Full Headers</EM> command displays
message text.  If set, the raw message text will be displayed.  This
especially affects MIME formatted email, where the entire MIME format
will be displayed.  This feature similarly affects how messages are
included for the <EM>Export</EM>, <EM>Pipe</EM>, <EM>Print</EM>, <EM>Forward</EM>, 
and <EM>Reply</EM> functions.

<DT> <A NAME="enable-goto-in-file-browser"><EM>enable-goto-in-file-browser</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this causes <EM>Pine</EM> to offer the <EM>G Goto</EM> command in
the file browser. This command allows you to explicitly set the
displayed directory. <EM>Pine</EM>'s default behavior requires you to visit
each related directory when moving between two distant directories.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-incoming-folders"><EM>enable-incoming-folders</EM></A>

<DD> If set, this feature defines a pseudo-folder collection called
<EM>INCOMING MESSAGE FOLDERS</EM>.
Initially, the only folder included in this collection
will be your <EM>INBOX</EM>, which will no longer show up in your default
saved-message folder collection.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-jump-shortcut"><EM>enable-jump-shortcut</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this feature will allow you to enter a number (followed by RETURN)
and jump to that message number, when in the "Folder Index" or "Message Text"
screens. In other words, it obviates the need for typing the <EM>J</EM> for the
<EM>Jump</EM> command.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-lame-list-mode"><EM>enable-lame-list-mode</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the method Pine uses to ask your IMAP
server for folder names to display in the the FOLDER LIST screen.
It is intended to compensate for a small set of IMAP servers that
are programmed to ignore a part of the request, and thus respond
to <EM>Pine</EM>'s query with nonsensical results.
<P>

If you find that <EM>Pine</EM> is erroneously displaying blank folder lists,
try enabling this feature.
<P>

NOTE: Enabling this feature has consequences for the Goto and Save
commands.  Many servers allow access to folders outside the area
reserved for your personal folders via some reserved character,
typically '#' (sharp), '~' (tilde) or '/' (slash).  This mechanism
allows, at the Goto and Save prompts, quick access to folders
outside your personal folder collection without requiring a specific
collection definition.  This behavior will generally not be available
when this feature is enabled.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-mail-check-cue"><EM>enable-mail-check-cue</EM></A>

<DD> If set, this will cause an asterisk to appear in the upper
left-hand corner of the screen whenever <EM>Pine</EM> checks for new mail, and two
asterisks whenever <EM>Pine</EM> saves (checkpoints) the state of the current
mailbox to disk.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-mailcap-param-substitution"><EM>enable-mailcap-param-substitution</EM></A>

<DD> If set, this will allow mailcap named parameter substitution to occur
in mailcap entries.
By default, this is turned off to prevent security problems which may occur
with some incorrect mailcap configurations.
For more information, RFC1524 and look for "named parameters" in the
text of the RFC.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-mouse-in-xterm"><EM>enable-mouse-in-xterm</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls whether or not an X terminal mouse can be used with
<EM>Pine</EM>. If set, and the <CODE>$DISPLAY</CODE> variable indicates that an
X terminal is being used, the left mouse button on the mouse can be
used to select text or commands.
<P>
 
Note: if this feature is set, the behavior of X terminal cut-and-paste is
also modified. It is necessary to hold the shift key down while clicking
left or middle mouse buttons for the normal xterm cut/paste operations.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-msg-view-addresses"><EM>enable-msg-view-addresses</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the behavior of <EM>Pine</EM>'s "Message Text" screen.
Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to select possible email addresses
from the displayed text and display them in boldface for selection.
<P>

The first available email address is displayed in inverse.  This is the
"selected" address.
Pressing <EM>RETURN</EM> will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to enter the message
composition screen with the To field filled in with the selected address.
<P>

Use the up and down arrow keys to change which of the addresses
displayed in boldface is the current selection.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-msg-view-attachments"><EM>enable-msg-view-attachments</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the behavior of <EM>Pine</EM>'s "Message Text" screen.
Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to present attachments in boldface.
The first available attachment is displayed in inverse.  This is the
"selected" attachment.  Pressing <EM>RETURN</EM> will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to display
the selected attachment.  Use the up and down arrow keys to change which of the
attachments displayed in boldface is the current selection.
<P>
 
Speaking of arrow keys, the Up and Down Arrows will select the next
and previous attachments if one is available on the screen for selection.
Otherwise, they will simply adjust the viewed text one line up or down.
<P>
  
Similarly, when selectable items are present in a message, the Ctrl-F
key can be used to select the next item in the message independent
of which portion of the viewed message is currently displayed. The
Ctrl-B key can be used to select the previous item in the same way.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-msg-view-forced-arrows"><EM>enable-msg-view-forced-arrows</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies Up and Down arrow key behavior in <EM>Pine</EM>'s
"Message Text" screen when selectable Attachments, URL's, or
web-hostnames are presented. <EM>Pine</EM>'s usual behavior is to move to
the next or previous selectable item if currently displayed or
simply to adjust the screen view by one line if the next selectable line
is off the screen.
<P>
 
Setting this feature causes the Up and Down arrow keys to behave as
if no selectable items were present in the message.
<P>
  
Note, the <EM>Ctrl-F</EM> (next selectable item) and
<EM>Ctrl-B</EM> (previous selectable item) functionality is unchanged.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-msg-view-urls"><EM>enable-msg-view-urls</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the behavior of <EM>Pine</EM>'s "Message Text" screen.
Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to select possible URL's from the
displayed text and display them in boldface for selection.
<P>

The first available URL is displayed in inverse.  This is the
"selected" URL.  Pressing <EM>RETURN</EM> will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to display
the selected URL via either built-in means as with <CODE>mailto:</CODE>,
<CODE>imap:</CODE>, <CODE>news:</CODE>, and <CODE>nntp:</CODE>,
or via an external application as defined
by the <A HREF="#url-viewers"><EM>url-viewers</EM></A> variable.
<P>

Use the up and down arrow keys to change which of the URLs displayed in boldface
is the current selection.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-msg-view-web-hostnames"><EM>enable-msg-view-web-hostnames</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the behavior of <EM>Pine</EM>'s "Message Text" screen.
Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to select possible web hostnames
from the displayed text and display them in boldface for selection.
<P>

The first available hostname is displayed in inverse.  This is the
"selected" hostname.  Pressing <EM>RETURN</EM> will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to display
the selected hostname via an external application as defined
by the <A HREF="#url-viewers"><EM>url-viewers</EM></A> variable.
<P>

Use the up and down arrow keys to change which of the hostnames displayed in
boldface is the current selection.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-newmail-in-xterm-icon"><EM>enable-newmail-in-xterm-icon</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls whether or not <EM>Pine</EM> will attempt to announce new
mail arrival when it is running in an X terminal window and that window
is iconified.
If set, and the <CODE>$DISPLAY</CODE> variable indicates that an X
terminal is being used, <EM>Pine</EM> will send appropriate escape sequences to
the X terminal to modify the label on <EM>Pine</EM>'s icon to indicate that new
mail has arrived.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-partial-match-lists"><EM>enable-partial-match-lists</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects the subcommands available when <EM>Sav</EM>ing
or Opening a new folder. If set, the subcommand <EM>^X ListMatches</EM> will be
available. This command allows you to type in a substring of the folder
you are looking for and when you type <EM>^X</EM> it will display all folders
which contain that substring in their names.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-print-via-y-command"><EM>enable-print-via-y-command</EM></A>

<DD> By default, <EM>Pine</EM>'s print command is available by pressing the <EM>%</EM>
key. In recent versions prior to 4.00, the print command was accessed by
pressing the <EM>Y</EM> key.
<P>
 
Enabling this feature will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to recognize both the old
command, <EM>Y</EM>, and the new <EM>%</EM> method for invoking
printing.  Note, key menu labels are not changed as a result of
enabling this feature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-reply-indent-string-editing"><EM>enable-reply-indent-string-editing</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects the Reply command's &quot;Include original message
in Reply?&quot; prompt.  When enabled, it causes the
&quot;Edit Indent String&quot; sub-command to appear which allows 
you to edit the string <EM>Pine</EM> would otherwise use to denote included 
text from the message being replied to.<P>

Thus, you can change <EM>Pine</EM>'s default message quote character (usually
an angle bracket) on a per message basis. So you could change your quoted message to
look, for example, like this:<p>
 
<pre>On Tues, 26 Jan 1999, John Q. Smith wrote:
 
John: I just wanted to say hello and to congratulate you
John: on a job well done!</pre><p>

The configuration option
<A HREF="#reply-ind-str">&quot;reply-indent-string&quot;</A>
may be used to change what appears as the default string to be edited.
<P>
NOTE: Edited reply-indent-strings only apply to the message
currently being replied to.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-rules-under-take"><EM>enable-rules-under-take</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, the Take command takes addresses from a message and helps you
put them into your Address Book.
If you use Rules for Indexcolors, Roles, Filtering, or Scoring;
you may find it useful
to be able to Take information from a message's headers and put it into
a new Rule.
When this feature is set, you will be given an extra prompt which gives
you the choice to Take into the Address Book or Take into a rule.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-search-and-replace"><EM>enable-search-and-replace</EM></A>

<DD> If set <EM>Pine</EM>'s composer offers the <EM>R Replace</EM> command
option inside the <EM>W WhereIs</EM> command.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-sigdashes"><EM>enable-sigdashes</EM></A>

<DD> If set and a <EM>signature-file</EM> exists, the line consisting of
the three characters "<CODE>-- </CODE>" (dash dash space) is included
before the signature.
This only happens if the signature doesn't already contain such a line.
<P>
In addition, when you Reply or Followup to a message containing one of
these special lines and choose to include its text, <EM>Pine</EM> will observe
the convention of not including text beyond the special line in your
reply.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-suspend"><EM>enable-suspend</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this feature will allow you to type <EM>^Z</EM>
and temporarily suspend <EM>Pine</EM>. Not available on <EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-tab-completion"><EM>enable-tab-completion</EM></A>

<DD> This feature enables the <EM>TAB</EM> key when
at a prompt for a filename. In this
case, <EM>TAB</EM> will cause the
partial name already entered to be automatically
completed, provided the partial name is unambiguous.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-take-export"><EM>enable-take-export</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, the Take command takes addresses from a message and helps you
put them into your Address Book.
When this feature is set, you will be given an extra prompt which gives you
the choice to Take addresses into a file instead of your Address
Book.
Only the user@domain_name part of the address is put in the file.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-tray-icon"><EM>enable-tray-icon</EM></A>

<DD> <EM>PC-Pine</EM> only.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-unix-pipe-cmd"><EM>enable-unix-pipe-cmd</EM></A>

<DD> This feature enables the <EM>| Pipe</EM> command
that sends the current message
to the specified Unix command for external processing. Not available on
<EM>PC-Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="enable-verbose-smtp-posting"><EM>enable-verbose-smtp-posting</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s message sending.  When enabled,
<EM>Pine</EM> will send a <CODE>VERB</CODE> (i.e., VERBose) command
early in the posting process
intended to cause the server SMTP to provide a more detailed account of
the transaction.  This feature is typically only useful to system
administrators and other support personel as an aid in troublshooting
problems.
 
Note, this feature relies on a specific capability of the system's mail
transport agent or configured <A HREF="#smtp-server"><EM>smtp-server</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expanded-view-of-addressbooks"><EM>expanded-view-of-addressbooks</EM></A>

<DD> If multiple address books (either personal or global) are defined, and you
wish to have them all expanded implicitly upon entering the ADDRESS BOOK
screen, then set this feature. This feature will have no effect unless the
feature
<A HREF="#combined-addrbook-display"><EM>combined-addrbook-display</EM></A>
is also set.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expanded-view-of-distribution-lists"><EM>expanded-view-of-distribution-lists</EM></A>

<DD> If this feature is set, then distribution lists in the address book
screen will always be expanded automatically.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expanded-view-of-folders"><EM>expanded-view-of-folders</EM></A>

<DD> If multiple folder collections are defined, and you
wish to have them all expanded implicitly upon entering the FOLDER LIST
screen, then set this feature. This feature will have no effect unless the
feature
<A HREF="#combined-folder-display"><EM>combined-folder-display</EM></A>
is also set.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expose-hidden-config"><EM>expose-hidden-config</EM></A>

<DD> The purpose of this feature is to allow you to change configuration
features and variables which are normally hidden.
This is particularly useful if you are using a remote configuration file,
where it is difficult to edit the file manually, but it may also be used
on a local pinerc configuration file.
<P>
If set, most configuration variables and features which are normally
hidden from view will show up in the Setup/Configuration screen.
They will be at the bottom of the configuration screen.
You can find them by searching for the word &quot;hidden&quot;.
<P>

Note that this is an advanced feature which should be used with care.
The reason that this part of the configuration is normally hidden is because
there is a significant potential for causing problems if you change these
variables.
If something breaks after a change try changing it back to see if that is
what is causing the problem.
There are also some variables which are normally hidden because they are
manipulated through <EM>Pine</EM> in other ways.
For example, the &quot;address-book&quot; variable is normally set using
the Setup/AddressBooks screen, so there is little reason to edit it directly.
The &quot;incoming-folders&quot; variable is normally changed by using
the Add, Delete, and Rename commands in the FOLDER LIST screen,
and the &quot;last-time-prune-questioned&quot; variable is normally used
internally by <EM>Pine</EM> and not set directly by the user.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expunge-only-manually"><EM>expunge-only-manually</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, when you close a folder which contains deleted messages you are
asked if you want to expunge those messages from the folder permanently.
If this feature is set, you won't be asked and the deleted messages will
remain in the folder.
If you choose to set this feature you will have to expunge the
messages manually using the eXpunge command, which you can use while
in the MESSAGE INDEX screen.
If you do not expunge deleted messages the size of your
folder will continue to increase until you are out of disk space.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expunge-wo-confirm"><EM>expunge-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> If set, you will not be prompted to confirm your intent before
the expunge takes place. Actually, you will still be prompted for confirmation
if the folder is not the <EM>INBOX</EM> folder or another folder in the
Incoming Folders collection. See the <EM>expunge-without-confirm-everywhere</EM>
feature which follows.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="expunge-without-confirm-everywhere"><EM>expunge-without-confirm-everywhere</EM></A>

<DD> The regular <EM>expunge-without-confirm</EM> feature actually only
works for the <EM>INBOX</EM> folder and for other folders in the "Incoming
Folders" collection. If this feature is set then you also won't be prompted
to confirm expunges for all other folders.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="fcc-on-bounce"><EM>fcc-on-bounce</EM></A>

<DD> If set, normal Fcc (File Carbon Copy) processing will be
done for bounced messages,
just as if you had composed a message to the address you are
bouncing to. If not set, no Fcc of the message will be saved.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="fcc-only-without-confirm"><EM>fcc-only-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> This features controls an aspect of Pine's composer.
The only time this feature will be used is if you attempt to send mail
which has no recipients but does have an Fcc.
Normally, Pine will ask if you really mean to copy the message only to
the Fcc.
That is, it asks if you really meant to have no recipients.
If this feature is set, you
will <B>not</B> be prompted to confirm your intent to make only a copy
of a message with no recipients.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="fcc-without-attachments"><EM>fcc-without-attachments</EM></A>

<DD> This features controls the way FCC's (File Carbon Copies) are
made of the messages you send.

<P>
Normally, <EM>Pine</EM> saves an exact copy of your message as it was sent.
When this feature is enabled, the &quot;body&quot; of the message
you send (the text you type in the composer) is preserved in the 
copy as before, however all attachments are replaced with text
explaining what had been sent rather than the attachments themselves.

<P>
This feature also affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s &quot;Send ?&quot; confirmation prompt
in that a new &quot;^F Fcc Attchmnts&quot; option becomes available which
allows you to interactively set whether or not attachments are saved
to the Fcc'd copy.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="include-attachments-in-reply"><EM>include-attachments-in-reply</EM></A>

<DD> If set, any MIME
attachments that were part of the original message will automatically be
included in a <EM>Reply</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="include-header-in-reply"><EM>include-header-in-reply</EM></A>

<DD> If set, and a
message being replied to is included in the <EM>Reply</EM>,
then headers from that
message will also be part of the reply.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="include-text-in-reply"><EM>include-text-in-reply</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, <EM>Pine</EM> will ask whether you
wish to include the original message in your <EM>Reply</EM>.
If this feature is set and the feature
<A HREF="#enable-reply-indent-string-editing"><EM>enable-reply-indent-string-editing</EM></A>
is <EM>not</EM> set, then the original message will be included in the reply
automatically, without prompting.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="ldap-result-to-addrbook-add"><EM>ldap-result-to-addrbook-add</EM></A>

<DD> This is only available if <EM>Pine</EM> was linked with an LDAP library
when it was compiled.
If both the per-directory-server option
<A HREF="#use-implicitly-from-composer"><EM>use-implicitly-from-composer</EM></A>
and this feature are set,
then when an implicit directory lookup is done from the
composer you will automatically be prompted to add the result of the
directory lookup to your address book.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="mark-fcc-seen"><EM>mark-fcc-seen</EM></A>

<DD> This features controls the way FCCs (File Carbon Copies) are
made of the messages you send.
Normally, when <EM>Pine</EM> saves a copy of a message you sent as an Fcc, that
copy will be marked as Unseen.
When you look at the folder it was saved in the message will appear to
be a New message until you read it.
When this feature is enabled, the message will be marked as having
been Seen.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="mark-for-cc"><EM>mark-for-cc</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects Pine's MESSAGE INDEX display.
By default, a '+' is displayed in the first column if the
message is addressed directly to you.
When this feature is set and the message is not addressed to you, then a
'-' character is displayed if the message is instead Cc'd directly
to you.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-approximates-new-status"><EM>news-approximates-new-status</EM></A>

<DD> This feature causes certain messages to be marked as <EM>New</EM> in the
"Folder Index" of newsgroups.
<P>

When opening a newsgroup, <EM>Pine</EM> will consult
your <EM>newsrc</EM> file and
determine the last message you have previously disposed of via the <EM>D</EM>
key.  If this feature is set, any subsequent messages will be shown in the
Index with an <EM>N</EM>, and the first of these messages will be highlighted.
Although this is only an approximation of true <EM>New</EM> or <EM>Unseen</EM>
status, it provides a useful cue to distinguish more-or-less recent
messages from those you have seen previously, but are not yet ready to
mark deleted.
<P>

Background: your <EM>newsrc</EM> file (used to store message status information
for newsgroups) is only capable of storing a single flag, and <EM>Pine</EM> uses
this to record whether or not you are "done with" a message, as
indicated by marking the message as <EM>Deleted</EM>.  Unfortunately, this
means that <EM>Pine</EM> has no way to record exactly which messages you have
previously seen, so it normally does not show the <EM>N</EM> status flag for
any messages in a newsgroup. This feature enables a starting
<I>approximation</I> of seen/unseen status that may be useful.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-deletes-across-groups"><EM>news-deletes-across-groups</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls what <EM>Pine</EM> does when you delete a
message in a newsgroup that appears in more than one newsgroup.
Such a message is sometimes termed a &quot;crossposting&quot;
in that it was posted across several newsgroups.

<P>
<EM>Pine</EM>'s default behavior when you delete such a message is to remove
only the copy in the current newsgroup from view when you use the
&quot;Exclude&quot; command or the next time you visit the newsgroup.

<P>
Enabling this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to remove every occurrence of the
message from all newsgroups it appears in and to which you are
subscribed.

<P>
NOTE: As currently implemented, enabling this feature may increase the
time it takes the Expunge command and newsgroup closing to complete.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-offers-catchup-on-close"><EM>news-offers-catchup-on-close</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls what <EM>Pine</EM> does as it closes a newsgroup.
When set, <EM>Pine</EM> will offer to delete all messages from the newsgroup
as you are quitting <EM>Pine</EM> or opening a new folder.

<P>
This feature is useful if you typically read all the interesting messages
in a newsgroup each time you open it.  This feature saves you from
having to delete each message in a newsgroup as you read it or from
selecting all the messages and doing an
aggregate delete before you move on to the next folder or newsgroup.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-post-without-validation"><EM>news-post-without-validation</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls whether the NNTP server is queried as newsgroups
are entered for posting.  Validation over slow links (e.g. dialup using
SLIP or PPP) can cause delays.  Set this feature to eliminate such delays.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-read-in-newsrc-order"><EM>news-read-in-newsrc-order</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls the order that newsgroups will be presented.  If
set, they will be presented in the same order as they occur in
your <EM>newsrc</EM> file.
If not set, the newsgroups
will be presented in alphabetical order.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="next-thread-without-confirm"><EM>next-thread-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s Next and Prev commands in
the case where you are using one of the
&quot;separate-index-screen&quot; styles for the configuration option
<A HREF="#threading-index-style"><EM>threading-index-style</EM></A>
and currently have the folder sorted by a Threaded or OrderedSubject sort.
When you are Viewing a particular thread you have a
MESSAGE INDEX of only the messages in that thread.
If you press the Next command with the last message in the thread highlighted
you will normally be asked if you want to &quot;View next thread?&quot;,
assuming there is a next thread to view.
If this feature is set it will be assumed that you always want to view the
next thread and you won't be asked to confirm that.
Similarly, if the first message of the thread is highlighted and you
press the Prev command, this feature will prevent the question
&quot;View previous thread&quot;.
<P>
This feature only has an effect in the MESSAGE INDEX screen.
If you then view a particular message from that screen and press the
Next command, you will be sent to the next thread without being asked,
independent of the setting of this feature.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="pass-control-characters-as-is"><EM>pass-control-characters-as-is</EM></A>

<DD> UNIX <EM>Pine</EM> only (this feature is automatically on with <EM>PC-Pine</EM>).
If set, all characters in a message will be sent to the
screen. Normally, control characters are automatically suppressed in
order to avoid inadvertently changing terminal setup parameters.
Control characters are usually displayed as two character sequences like
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^C </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for Control-C or
<P><CENTER><SAMP> ^[ </SAMP></CENTER><P>
for ESCAPE (the three high-order bits are masked off of the control character to get the 2nd character to display).
Sometimes, in cases where changing a single control character into a
two-character sequence would confuse <EM>Pine</EM>'s display routines,
a question mark is substituted for the control character.
This feature is not available in <EM>PC-Pine</EM> where control characters
are never suppressed.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="prefer-plain-text"><EM>prefer-plain-text</EM></A>

<DD> A message being viewed may contain alternate versions of the same content.
Those alternate versions are ordered by the sending software such that the
first alternative is the least preferred and the last alternative is the
most preferred. Pine will normally display the most-preferred version that
it knows how to display. This is most often encountered where the two
alternate versions are a plain text version and an HTML version, with the
HTML version listed last as the most preferred.
<P>

If this option is set, then any plain text version will be preferred to
all other versions.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="preserve-start-stop-characters"><EM>preserve-start-stop-characters</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls how special control key characters, typically
<EM>^S</EM> and <EM>^Q</EM>, are interpreted when input to <EM>Pine</EM>.
These characters
are known as the "start" and "stop" characters and are sometimes used in
communications paths to control data flow between devices that operate at
different speeds.
<P>

By default, <EM>Pine</EM> turns the system's handling of these special characters
off except during printing.  However, if you see <EM>Pine</EM> reporting input errors
such as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
       [ Command "^Q" not defined for this screen. ] <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

and, at the same time, see your display become garbled, then it is likely
that setting this option will solve the problem.  Be aware, though, that
enabling this feature will also cause <EM>Pine</EM> to ostensibly "hang" 
whenever the <EM>Ctrl-S</EM> key combination is entered as the system is now
interpreting such input as a "stop output" command.  To "start
output"  again, simply type <EM>Ctrl-Q</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="print-formfeed-between-messages"><EM>print-formfeed-between-messages</EM></A>

<DD> Setting this feature causes a formfeed to be printed between messages when
printing multiple messages with the <EM>Apply Print</EM> command.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="print-includes-from-line"><EM>print-includes-from-line</EM></A>

<DD> If this feature is set, then the Unix mail style From line is included
at the start of each message that is printed.  This line looks something
like the following, with the address replaced by the address from the
From line of the message being printed:
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    From user@domain.somewhere.com Mon May 13 14:11:06 1996 <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="print-index-enabled"><EM>print-index-enabled</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls the behavior of the <EM>Print</EM> command
when in the
"Folder Index" screen.
If set, the <EM>Print</EM> command will give you a prompt
asking if you wish to print the message index, or the currently highlighted
message. If not set, the message will be printed.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt"><EM>print-offers-custom-cmd-prompt</EM></A>

<DD> When this feature is set, the <EM>Print</EM> command
will have an additional
subcommand called <EM>C CustomPrint</EM>.
If selected, you will have
the opportunity to enter any system print command, instead of being 
restricted to using those that have been previously configured in the 
<EM>Setup/Printer</EM> screen.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-attachment-extra-prompt"><EM>quell-attachment-extra-prompt</EM></A>
<DD> By default, when you attempt to view an attachment externally
from the &quot;Attachment View&quot; screen, you are asked if you
really want to view the selected attachment.

<P>
If this feature is set, you will <B>not</B> be prompted to confirm
your selection.  Prior to <EM>Pine</EM> 4.50, the default behavior was to not
prompt. This feature was added for those wanting to preserve that
behavior.

<DT> <A NAME="quell-berkeley-format-timezone"><EM>quell-berkeley-format-timezone</EM></A>

<DD> POSIX mandates a timezone in UNIX mailbox format folder delimiters
(the line which begins with From <SPACE>).
Some versions of Berkeley mail have trouble with this, and don't recognize
the line as a message delimiter.
If this feature is set, the timezone will be left off the delimiter line.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-content-id"><EM>quell-content-id</EM></A>

<DD> This feature changes the behavior of <EM>Pine</EM> when sending messages.
It is intended to work around a bug in Microsoft's Outlook XP mail user
agent.
As of this writing, Microsoft has acknowledged the bug but
has not added it to the Knowledge Base.
We have been told that there will be a post-SP1 hotfix for Outlook XP.
This particular bug has bug fix number OfficeQFE:4781.
The nature of the bug is that messages with attachments which
contain a Content-ID header (which standard <EM>Pine</EM> attachments do)
do not show the attachment indicator (a paperclip) when viewed with
Outlook XP.
So the user has no indication that the message contains an attachment.

<P>
If this feature is set then <EM>Pine</EM> will remove most Content-ID headers
before sending a message.
If an attachment is of type MESSAGE, then the existing Content-ID headers
inside the message will be left intact.
This would only happen with <EM>Pine</EM> if a message was forwarded as an attachment
or if a message with a message attached was forwarded.
Similarly if an attachment of type MULTIPART/ALTERNATIVE is forwarded,
the Content-ID headers of the alternative parts will not be removed.

<P>
Because the Content-ID header is a standard part of MIME it is possible
that setting this feature will break something.
For example, if an attachment has a Content-ID header which is necessary
for the correct functioning of that attachment, it is possible that <EM>Pine</EM>
may remove that header when the attachment is forwarded.
However, it seems fairly safe at this time.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-dead-letter-on-cancel"><EM>quell-dead-letter-on-cancel</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when you cancel a message being
composed.  <EM>Pine</EM>'s usual behavior is to write the canceled message to
a file named <CODE>dead.letter</CODE> in your home directory (under UNIX;
<CODE>DEADLETR</CODE> under WINDOWS/DOS) overwriting any previous message.
Under some conditions (some routine), this can introduce a noticeable delay.
<P>
 
Setting this feature will cause <EM>Pine</EM> NOT to write canceled compositions
into the file called <CODE>dead.letter</CODE>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-empty-directories"><EM>quell-empty-directories</EM></A>

<DD> This feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to remove from the display any directories
that do not contain at least one file or directory.  This can be useful
to prevent overly cluttered folder lists when a collection is stored on
a server that treats all names as both a folder and a directory.

<P>
Note, enabling this feature can cause surprising behavior!  For example,
you can still use Add to create a directory, but unless you immediately
enter that directory and create a folder, that newly created directory
may not be displayed next time you enter the folder list.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-extra-post-prompt"><EM>quell-extra-post-prompt</EM></A>

<DD> This feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to skip the extra question about
posting a message which may go to thousands of readers when you
are about to post to a newsgroup.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-folder-internal-msg"><EM>quell-folder-internal-msg</EM></A>

<DD> This feature determines whether or not <EM>Pine</EM> will create 
&quot;pseudo messages&quot; in folders that are in standard Unix or 
MMDF format.
<P> 

<EM>Pine</EM> will normally create these
pseudo messages when they are not already
present in a standard Unix or MMDF folder.
Their purpose is to record
certain mailbox state data needed for correct IMAP and POP server operation,
and also for <EM>Pine</EM> to be able to mark messages as Answered when
the Reply has been postponed.
<P>

Sites which do not use IMAP/POP for remote mail access, and which need to
support mail tools that are adversely affected by the presence of the
pseudo-messages (e.g. some mail notification tools) may enable this
feature to tell <EM>Pine</EM> not to create them.
Note that <EM>Pine</EM>'s &quot;Answered&quot; flag
capability will be adversely affected if this is done.
<P>

Note too that, even if this feature is enabled, <EM>Pine</EM> will not remove
pseudo-messages when it encounters them (e.g. those created by UW's imapd
or ipopd servers.)
This feature has no effect on folders that are not in
standard Unix or MMDF format, as pseudo-messages are not needed in the
other formats to record mailbox state information.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-imap-envelope-update"><EM>quell-imap-envelope-update</EM></A>

<DD> In the MESSAGE INDEX screen, if the open folder is being accessed
using IMAP, <EM>Pine</EM> normally tries to paint the index lines on the screen
as soon as the information arrives from the IMAP server.
This means that the index information makes it onto the screen more quickly
than it otherwise would.
This sometimes results in behavior that bothers some users.
For example, when paging to a new page of the index, it may be possible for
the lines to be painted on the screen in a random order, rather than from
top to bottom.
<P>

Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to wait for all of the information
to be gathered before it paints the index screen.
Once it collects all of the information, the screen will be painted quickly
from top to bottom.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-lock-failure-warnings"><EM>quell-lock-failure-warnings</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when it encounters a problem
acquiring a mail folder lock.  Typically, a secondary file associated
with the mail folder being opened is created as part of the locking
process.  On some systems, such file creation has been administratively
precluded by the system configuration.
<P>

<EM>Pine</EM> issues a warning when such failures occur, which can become bothersome
if the system is configured to disallow such actions.  Setting this
feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to remain silent when this part of lock creation fails.
<P>

WARNING: systems that have been configured in a way that precludes locking
introduce some risk of mail folder corruption when more than one program
attempts to modify the mail folder.  This is most likely to occur to one's
<EM>INBOX</EM> or other "Incoming Message Folder".
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-maildomain-warning"><EM>quell-maildomain-warning</EM></A>

<DD> When your configuration is set up so that your domain name contains no dots,
it is usually a configuration error.
By default, <EM>Pine</EM> will warn you about this when you start it up.
You will see a warning message that looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Incomplete maildomain &quot;&lt;domain&gt;&quot;.</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
If this feature is set, the warning is turned off.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-news-envelope-update"><EM>quell-news-envelope-update</EM></A>

<DD> In the MESSAGE INDEX screen, if the open folder is being accessed
using NNTP (News), <EM>Pine</EM> normally tries to paint the index lines on the screen
as soon as the information arrives from the NNTP server.
This means that the index information makes it onto the screen more quickly
than it otherwise would.
This sometimes results in behavior that bothers some users.
For example, when paging to a new page of the index, it may be possible for
the lines to be painted on the screen in a random order, rather than from
top to bottom.
<P>

Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to wait for all of the information
to be gathered before it paints the index screen.
Once it collects all of the information, the screen will be painted quickly
from top to bottom.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-partial-fetching"><EM>quell-partial-fetching</EM></A>

<DD> Partial fetching is a feature of the IMAP protocol.
By default, <EM>Pine</EM>
will use partial fetching when copying the contents of a message or attachment
from the IMAP server to <EM>Pine</EM>.
This means that the fetch will be done in many
small chunks instead of one big chunk. The main benefit of this approach is
that the fetch becomes interruptible. That is, the user can type <EM>^C</EM>
to stop the fetch early. In some cases partial fetching may cause a performance
problem so that the fetching of data takes significantly longer when partial
fetching is used. Turning on this feature will turn off partial fetching.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-ssl-largeblocks"><EM>quell-ssl-largeblocks</EM></A>

<DD> This feature (<EM>PC-Pine</EM> only) changes the behavior of fetching messages
and attachments so that the message data is fetched in chunks no larger
than 12K bytes.
This works around a bug in Microsoft's SSL/TLS support.
Some versions of Microsoft SSL are not able to read full-sized (16K)
SSL/TLS packets.
Some servers will send such packets and this will
cause <EM>PC-Pine</EM> to crash with the error

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>incomplete SecBuffer exceeds maximum buffer size</SAMP></CENTER>

<P>
Microsoft is aware of the problem and has developed a hotfix for it, but as of
this writing the hotfix has not yet been added to the Knowledge Base.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-status-message-beeping"><EM>quell-status-message-beeping</EM></A>

<DD> If set status messages will never emit a beep.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-timezone-comment-when-sending"><EM>quell-timezone-comment-when-sending</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, when <EM>Pine</EM> generates a Date header for outgoing mail,
it will try to include the symbolic timezone at the end of the
header inside parentheses.
The symbolic timezone is often three characters long, but on
some operating systems, it may be longer.
Apparently there are some SMTP servers in the world which will reject an
incoming message if it has a Date header longer than about 80 characters.
If this feature is set, the symbolic timezone normally generated by
<EM>Pine</EM> will not be included.
You probably don't need to worry about this feature unless you run into
the problem described above.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file"><EM>quell-user-lookup-in-passwd-file</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of
<EM>Pine</EM>'s Composer, and if needed, will usually be set by the
system manager in <EM>Pine</EM>'s system-wide configuration file.
Specifically, if this feature is set, <EM>Pine</EM> will not attempt to look
in the system password file to find a Full Name for the entered address.
<P>

Normally, names you enter into address fields (e.g. To: or Cc:) are
checked against your address book(s) to see if they match an address book
nickname.
Failing that, (in Unix <EM>Pine</EM>) the name is then checked against
the Unix password file.  If the entered name matches a username in the
system password file, <EM>Pine</EM> extracts the corresponding Full Name information
for that individual, and adds that to the address being entered.
<P>

However, password file matching can have surprising (incorrect) results if
other users of the system do not receive mail at the domain you are using.
That is, if either the <A HREF="#user-domain"><EM>user-domain</EM></A>
or <A HREF="#use-only"><EM>use-only-domain-name</EM></A> option
is set such that the administrative domain of other users on the system
isn't accurately reflected, <EM>Pine</EM> should be told that a password
file match is coincidental,
and Full Name info will be incorrect.
For example, a
personal name from the password file could get falsely paired with the
entered name as it is turned into an address in the configured domain.
<P>

If you are seeing this behavior, enabling this feature will prevent Unix
<EM>Pine</EM> from looking up names in the password file to find the Full Name
for incomplete addresses you enter.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quit-without-confirm"><EM>quit-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls whether or not <EM>Pine</EM> will ask for confirmation when a
<EM>Quit</EM> command is received.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="reply-always-uses-reply-to"><EM>reply-always-uses-reply-to</EM></A>

<DD> If set, <EM>Pine</EM>
will not prompt when a message being replied to contains a <EM>Reply-To:</EM>
header value, but will simply use its value (as opposed to using the
<EM>From:</EM> field's value).
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quell-berkeley-format-timezone"><EM>quell-berkeley-format-timezone</EM></A>

<DD>
Versions of <EM>Pine</EM> prior to 4.20 would write Berkeley format
message delimiters with a trailing timezone offset.  On rare occurances
this can cause an incompatibility with other mail access utilities.
Enabling this hidden feature will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to refrain from writing
this timezone to the &quot;From&nbsp;&quot; delimiter.
<P>
</DD>

<DT> <A NAME="save-aggregates-copy-sequence"><EM>save-aggregates-copy-sequence</EM></A>

<DD> This feature will optimize an aggregate copy operation, if
possible, by issuing a single IMAP <EM>COPY</EM> command with a
list of the messages to be copied.
This may save network traffic when the source and destination
folders are on the same IMAP server.
<EM>However, many IMAP servers (including the UW IMAP server) do
not preserve the order of messages when this optimization is applied.</EM>
If this feature is not enabled, or if
the folders are on different IMAP servers, or the folders are local and in
different formats, <EM>Pine</EM> will copy each message individually.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="save-will-advance"><EM>save-will-advance</EM></A>

<DD> If set, <EM>Save</EM> will
(in addition to copying the current message to the designated folder) also
advance to the next message.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="save-will-not-delete"><EM>save-will-not-delete</EM></A>

<DD> If set, <EM>Save</EM> will
not mark the message Deleted (its default behavior) after it has been
copied to the designated folder.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="save-will-quote"><EM>save-will-quote-leading-froms</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of the <EM>Save</EM> command
(and also the way
outgoing messages are saved to an FCC folder).  If set, <EM>Pine</EM> will add
a leading <CODE>&gt;</CODE> character in front of message
lines beginning with "From" when they are
saved to another folder, including lines syntactically
distinguishable from the type of message separator line commonly used on
Unix systems.
<P>
 
The default behavior is that a <CODE>&gt;</CODE> will be prepended only to lines
beginning with "From " that might otherwise be confused with a message
separator line on Unix systems.  If <EM>Pine</EM> is the only mail program you use,
this default is reasonable.  If another program you use has trouble
displaying a message with an unquoted From saved by <EM>Pine</EM>, you should
enable this feature.  This feature only applies to the common Unix mailbox
format that uses message separator lines beginning with "From ".  If
<EM>Pine</EM> has been configured to use a different mailbox format (possibly
incompatible with other mail programs), then this issue does not arise,
and the feature is irrelevant.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="scramble-message-id"><EM>scramble-message-id</EM></A>

<DD> Normally the Message-ID header that <EM>Pine</EM> generates when sending a message
contains the name of the computer from which the message is being sent.
Some believe that this hostname could be used by spammers or could
be used by others for nefarious purposes.
If this feature is set, that name will be transformed with a simple
Rot13 transformation.
The result will still have the correct syntax for a Message-ID but the
part of the MessageID that is often a domain name will not be an actual
domain name because the letters will be scrambled.
<P>
It is possible (but unlikely?) that some spam detection
software will use that as a reason to reject the mail as spam.
It has also been reported that some spam detection software uses the
fact that there are no dots after the &quot;@&quot; as a reason to reject
messages.
If your <EM>PC-Pine</EM> Message-ID is using a name without a dot that is because
that is what Windows thinks is your &quot;Full computer name&quot;.
The method used to set this varies from one type of Windows to another but
check under Settings -> Control Panel -> System and
look for Network Identification or Computer Name or something similar.
How to set it is beyond the scope of <EM>Pine</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="select-without-confirm"><EM>select-without-confirm</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of
<EM>Pine</EM>'s <EM>Save</EM>, <EM>Export</EM>, and <EM>Goto</EM> commands.
These commands all take text input to specify the name of the folder or
file to be used, but allow you to press <EM>^T</EM> for a
list of possible names.
If set, the selected name will be used immediately, without further
opportunity to confirm or edit the name.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="separate-folder-and-directory-display"><EM>separate-folder-and-directory-display</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects folder collections wherein a folder
and directory can have the same name.  By default, <EM>Pine</EM> displays them
only once, denoting that it is both a folder and directory by appending
the folder name with the hierarchy character enclosed
in square brackets.
<P>

Enabling this feature will cause <EM>Pine</EM> to display such names
separately marking the name representing a directory with a trailing
hierarchy delimiter (typically the slash, &quot;/&quot;, character).
<P>

The feature also alters the command set slightly.  By default, the
right-arrow descends into the directory, while hitting the Return key will
cause the folder by that name to be opened.
<P>

With this feature set, the Return key will open the hilited folder, or
enter the hilited directory.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="show-cursor"><EM>show-cursor</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the system
cursor will move to convenient locations in the displays.  For example,
to the beginning of the status field of the highlighted index line, or
to the highlighted word after a successful <EM>WhereIs</EM> command.
It is intended to draw your attention to the <EM>interesting</EM>
spot on the screen.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="show-plain-text-internally"><EM>show-plain-text-internally</EM></A>

<DD> This feature modifies the method Pine uses to display Text/Plain
MIME attachments from the Attachment Index screen.  Normally, the
&quot;View&quot; command searches for any externally defined (usually
via the Mailcap file) viewer,
and displays the selected text within that viewer.

<P>
Enabling this feature causes Pine to ignore any external viewer
settings and always display text with Pine's internal viewer.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="show-selected-in-boldface"><EM>show-selected-in-boldface</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of <EM>Pine</EM>'s aggregate operation commands;
in particular, the <EM>Select</EM> and <EM>WhereIs</EM> commands.
<EM>Select</EM> and <EM>WhereIs</EM> (with
the <EM>^X</EM> subcommand) will search the current folder
for messages meeting a
specified criteria, and <EM>tag</EM> the resulting
messages with an <EM>X</EM> in the
first column of the applicable lines in the "Folder Index". If this feature
is set, instead of using the <EM>X</EM> to denote a selected message,
<EM>Pine</EM> will attempt to display those index lines in boldface.
Whether this is preferable to the <EM>X</EM> will depend on personal
taste and the type of terminal being used.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="sig-at-bot"><EM>signature-at-bottom</EM></A>

<DD> If this feature
is set, and a message being <EM>Repl</EM>ied to is being included in
the reply, then the
contents of the signature file (if any) will be inserted after the included
message.
This feature does not affect the results of a <EM>Forward</EM> command.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="single-column-folder-list"><EM>single-column-folder-list</EM></A>

<DD> If set, the "Folder List" screen will list one folder per line
instead of several per line.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="slash-collapses-entire-thread"><EM>slash-collapses-entire-thread</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, the Collapse/Expand Thread command Collapses or Expands the subthread which
starts at the currently highlighted message, if any.
If this feature is set, then the slash command Collapses or Expands the
<EM>entire</EM> current thread instead of just the subthread.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="spell-check-before-sending"><EM>spell-check-before-sending</EM></A>

<DD> When this feature is set, every composed message will be spell-checked before
being sent.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="store-window-position-in-config"><EM>store-window-position-in-config</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, <EM>PC-Pine</EM> will store its window size and position in the
Windows Registry.
This is convenient if you want to use the same remote
configuration from more than one PC.
If you use multiple configuration files to start <EM>PC-Pine</EM>, you may want
to store the window size and position in the configuration file instead
of in the Registry.
Setting this feature causes that to happen.

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="strip-from-sigdashes-on-reply"><EM>strip-from-sigdashes-on-reply</EM></A>

<DD> This feature doesn't do anything if the feature
<A HREF="#enable-sigdashes"><EM>enable-sigdashes</EM></A> is turned on.
However, if the <EM>enable-sigdashes</EM> feature is not turned on,
then turning on this feature enables support for the convention
of not including text beyond the sigdashes line when Replying or Following
up to a message and including the text of that message.
<P>
In other words, this is a way to turn on the signature stripping behavior
without also turning on the dashes-adding behavior.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="tab-visits-next-new-message-only"><EM>tab-visits-next-new-message-only</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when using the <EM>TAB</EM>
key to move from one message to the next.
<EM>Pine</EM>'s usual behavior is to select the next
<EM>Unread</EM> message or message flagged as <EM>Important</EM>.
<P>
 
Setting this feature causes <EM>Pine</EM> to skip the
messages flagged as <EM>Important</EM>,
and select <EM>Unread</EM> messages exclusively.
Tab behavior when there are no
new messages left to select remains unchanged.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="termdef-takes-precedence"><EM>termdef-takes-precedence</EM></A>

<DD> In some versions of <EM>Pine</EM> before 4.00 there was a compile-time macro
called <EM>TERMCAP_WINS</EM> which could be set to cause the <EM>termcap</EM>
or <EM>terminfo</EM> definitions to be used instead of the built in definitions.
Beginning with 4.00 this hidden runtime feature can be turned
on to accomplish the same thing.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="thread-index-shows-important-color"><EM>thread-index-shows-important-color</EM></A>

<DD> This option affects only the THREAD INDEX screen.
Whether or not you ever see a THREAD INDEX screen depends on the setting
of the configuration option
<A HREF="#threading-index-style"><EM>threading-index-style</EM></A>
and on the sort order of the index.
If a message within a thread is flagged as Important
and this option is set, then
the entire line in the THREAD INDEX will be colored the color of the
Index-important Symbol, which can be set using the
Setup Kolor screen.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="try-alternative-authentication-driver-first"><EM>try-alternative-authentication-driver-first</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects how <EM>Pine</EM> connects to IMAP servers.
It's utility has largely been overtaken by events,
but it may still be useful in some circumstances.
If you only connect to modern IMAP servers that support
&quot;TLS&quot; you can ignore this feature.

<P>
Details:

<P>
By default, <EM>Pine</EM> will attempt to connect to an IMAP server on the
normal IMAP service port (143), and if the server offers &quot;Transport Layer
Security&quot; (TLS) and <EM>Pine</EM> has been compiled with encryption capability,
then a secure (encrypted) session will be negotiated.

<P>
With this feature enabled, before connecting on the normal IMAP port, <EM>Pine</EM>
will first attempt to connect to an alternate IMAP service port (993) used
specifically for encrypted IMAP sessions via the Secure Sockets Layer
(SSL) method.
If the SSL attempt fails, <EM>Pine</EM> will then try the default
behavior described in the previous paragraph.

<P>
TLS negotiation on the normal port is preferred, and supersedes the use of
SSL on port 993, but older servers may not provide TLS support.
This feature may be convenient when accessing IMAP servers that do not support
TLS, but do support SSL connections on port 993.
However, it is important to understand that with this feature enabled,
<EM>Pine</EM> will <EM>attempt</EM> to make a secure connection if that is possible,
but it will proceed to make an insecure connection if that is the only
option offered by the server, or if the <EM>Pine</EM> in question has been built
without encryption capability.

<P>
Note that this feature specifies a per-user (or system-wide) default
behavior, but host/folder specification flags may be used to control the
behavior of any specific connection.
This feature interacts with some of
the possible host/folder path specification flags as follows:

<P>
The <SAMP>/tls</SAMP> host flag, for example,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.bar.com/tls}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will over-ride this feature for the specified host by bypassing the
SSL connection attempt.
Moreover, with <SAMP>/tls</SAMP> specified,
the connection attempt will fail if the
service on port 143 does not offer TLS support.

<P>
The <SAMP>/ssl</SAMP> host flag, for example,

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{foo.bar.com/ssl}INBOX</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will insist on an SSL connection for the specified host,
and will fail if the SSL service on port 993 is not available.
<EM>Pine</EM> will not subsequently retry a connection
on port 143 if <SAMP>/ssl</SAMP> is specified.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="unselect-will-not-advance"><EM>unselect-will-not-advance</EM></A>

<DD> Normally, when the Unselect current message command (:) is typed when the
current message is selected, the message will be unselected and the next
message will become the current message.
If this feature is set, the cursor will not advance to the next message.
Instead, the current message will remain the current message after
unselecting.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="use-current-dir"><EM>use-current-dir</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of several commands. If set, your
"current working directory" will be used instead of your home directory
for all of the following operations:

<UL>
<LI> <EM>Export</EM> in the "Folder Index" and "Message Text" screens
<LI> Attachment <EM>Save</EM> in the "Message Text" and "Attachment Text" screens
<LI> <EM>^R</EM> file inclusion in the Composer
<LI> <EM>^J</EM> file attachment in the Composer
</UL>
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="use-function-keys"><EM>use-function-keys</EM></A>

<DD> This feature specifies that <EM>Pine</EM> will
respond to function keys instead of
the normal single-letter commands. In this mode, the key menus at the
bottom of each screen will show function key designations instead of the
normal mnemonic key.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="use-sender-not-x-sender"><EM>use-sender-not-x-sender</EM></A>

<DD> Normally <EM>Pine</EM> on Unix adds a header line labeled <EM>X-X-Sender</EM>,
if the sender is different from the <EM>From:</EM> line.

<P>
The standard specifies that this header
line should be labeled <EM>Sender</EM>, not <EM>X-X-Sender</EM>.
Setting this feature causes
<EM>Sender</EM> to be used instead of <EM>X-X-Sender</EM>.  The standard also states
that the data associated with this header field should not be used as a Reply address.
Unfortunately, certain implementations of mail list management servers will use the
Sender address for such purposes.  These implementations often even recognize the
<EM>X-Sender</EM> fields as being equivalent to the <EM>Sender</EM> field, and use it
if present.  This is why Pine defaults to <EM>X-X-Sender</EM>.
<P>
Note, <EM>PC-Pine</EM> always adds
either an <EM>X-X-Sender</EM> line if there is an open, remote mailbox, or an
<EM>X-Warning: UNAuthenticated User</EM> otherwise

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="use-subshell-for-suspend"><EM>use-subshell-for-suspend</EM></A>

<DD> This feature affects <EM>Pine</EM>'s behavior when process suspension
is enabled and then activated via the <EM>^Z</EM> key.
<EM>Pine</EM> suspension allows one to
temporarily interact with the operating system command "shell" without
quitting <EM>Pine</EM>,
and then subsequently resume the still-active <EM>Pine</EM> session.
<P>

When the <EM>enable-suspend</EM> feature is set and subsequently the
<EM>^Z</EM> key is pressed,
<EM>Pine</EM> will normally suspend itself and return temporary
control to <EM>Pine</EM>'s parent shell process.
However, if this feature is set, <EM>Pine</EM> will instead create an
inferior subshell process.
This is useful when the parent process is not intended to be used
interactively.
Examples include invoking <EM>Pine</EM> via the <CODE>-e</CODE> argument
of the Unix <EM>xterm</EM> program, or via a menu system.
<P>

Note that one typically resumes a suspended <EM>Pine</EM> by entering the Unix
<EM>fg</EM> command, but if this feature is set, it will be necessary to enter
the <EM>exit</EM> command instead.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="vertical-folder-list"><EM>vertical-folder-list</EM></A>

<DD> This feature controls an aspect of Pine's FOLDER LIST screen.  If set,
the folders will be listed alphabetically down the columns rather
than across the columns as is the default.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="hidden-config">Hidden Config Variables and Features</A></H2>

There are several configuration variables and features which are normally hidden
from the user. That is, they don't appear on any of the configuration
screens. Some of these are suppressed because they are intended to be used
by system administrators, and in fact may only be set in system-wide
configuration files. Others are available to users but are thought to be
of such little value to most users that their presence on the Config
screens would cause more confusion than help. Those features may only be
set by hand editing the configuration file.
You may set the feature <A HREF="#expose-hidden-config">expose-hidden-config</A>
to cause most of these hidden variables and features to show up in
the Setup/Config screen.

email address, never the personal name.
For example, &quot;mailbox@domain&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>MAILBOX</DT>
<DD>
This is the same as the &quot;ADDRESS&quot; except that the

to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
It has the format MMM DD. For example, &quot;Oct 23&quot;.
</DD>

<DT>SMARTDATE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the date on which the message was sent, according
to the &quot;Date&quot; header field.
It is &quot;Today&quot; if the message was sent today,
&quot;Yesterday&quot; for yesterday,
&quot;Wednesday&quot; if it was last Wednesday, and so on. If the
message is from more than six months ago it includes the year, as well.
There is no adjustment made for different time zones, so you'll get
the day the message was sent according to the time zone the sender
was in.
</DD>

<DT>SMARTTIME</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the most relevant elements of the date on which
the message was sent (according to the &quot;Date&quot; header field),
in a compact form. If the message was sent today, only the time is used
(e.g. &quot;9:22am&quot;, &quot;10:07pm&quot;); if it was sent during
the past week, the day of the week and the hour are used
(e.g. &quot;Wed09am&quot;, &quot;Thu10pm&quot;); other dates are
given as date, month, and year (e.g. &quot;23Aug00&quot;,
&quot;9Apr98&quot;).
There is no adjustment made for different time zones, so you'll get
the day/time the message was sent according to the time zone the sender
was in.

</DL>

<P>
<H3><EM>Tokens Available Only for Index-Format</EM></H3>

<DL>
<DT>MSGNO</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the message's current position in the folder which,
of course, may change as the folder is sorted or new mail arrives.
</DD>

<DT>STATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents a three character wide field displaying various
aspects of the message's state.
The first character is either blank,
a '*' for message marked Important, or a '+' indicating a message
addressed directly to you (as opposed to your having received it via a
mailing list, for example).
When the feature
<A HREF="#mark-for-cc"><EM>mark-for-cc</EM></A>
is set, if the first character would have been
blank then it will instead be a '-' if the message is cc'd to you.
The second character is typically blank,
though the arrow cursor may occupy it if the 
<A HREF="#assume-slow-link"><EM>assume-slow-link</EM></A>
feature is set, or you actually are on a slow link.
The third character is either the letter 'D' if the
message is deleted, 'A' if it is answered (but not deleted), or 'N' if
it is new (but not deleted or answered), or blank if it is neither
deleted, answered nor new.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then this token refers to all of the messages in the collapsed portion of
the thread instead of just the top message.
The first character will be a '*' if <EM>any</EM> of the messages in the thread
are marked Important, else a '+' if any of the messages are addressed
to you, else a '-' if any of the messages are cc'd to you.
The third character will be a 'D' if <EM>all</EM> of the messages
in the collapsed thread are marked deleted, else it will be 'N' if any of
the messages are undeleted and unseen, and it will be blank otherwise.
</DD>

<DT>FULLSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents a less abbreviated alternative
to the &quot;STATUS&quot; token.
It is six characters wide.
The first character is '+', '-', or blank, the
second blank, the third either '*' or blank, the fourth 'N' or blank,
the fifth 'A' or blank, and the sixth character is either 'D' or
blank.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then this token refers to all of the messages in the collapsed portion of
the thread instead of just the top message.
The first character is '+', '-', or blank depending on whether <EM>any</EM>
of the messages in the collapsed thread are addressed to you or cc'd to you.
The third character will be '*' if any of the messages are marked
Important.
The fourth character will be 'N' if all of the messages in the thread
are New, else 'n' if some of the messages in the thread are New, else blank.
The fifth character will be 'A' or 'a' or blank, and the sixth character
will be 'D' or 'd' or blank.
</DD>

<DT>IMAPSTATUS</DT>
<DD>
This token represents an even less abbreviated alternative to the
&quot;STATUS&quot; token.
It differs from &quot;FULLSTATUS&quot; in only the fourth character which is
an 'N' if the message is new to this folder since the last time
it was opened <EM>and</EM> it has not been viewed, an 'R' (Recent) if the message
is new to the folder and has been viewed, a 'U' (Unseen) if the message is not 
new to the folder since it was last opened <EM>but</EM> has not been
viewed, or a blank if the message has been in the folder since it was
last opened and has been viewed.
<P>
If you are using a threaded view of the index and this message is at the
top of a collapsed portion of a thread,
then the fourth character will be
'N' if all of the messages in the thread are unseen and recent;
else 'n' if some of the messages in the thread are unseen and recent;
else 'U' if all of the messages in the thread are unseen and not recent;
else 'u' if some of the messages in the thread are unseen and not recent;
else 'R' if all of the messages in the thread are seen and recent;
else 'r' if some of the messages in the thread are seen and recent;
else blank.
</DD>

<DT>SIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes (rounded to the nearest 1,000).
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
Commas are not used in this field.
This field is seven characters wide, including the enclosing parentheses.
Sizes are rounded when &quot;K&quot; or &quot;M&quot; is present.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 9999 10K ... 999K 1.0M ... 99.9M 100M ... 2000M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>SIZECOMMA</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes (rounded to the nearest 1,000).
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
Commas are used if the number shown is 1,000 or greater.
The SIZECOMMA field is one character wider than the SIZE field.
Sizes are rounded when &quot;K&quot; or &quot;M&quot; is present.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 99,999 100K ... 9,999K 10.0M ... 999.9M 1,000M ... 2,000M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>KSIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size of the message, expressed in
kilobytes or megabytes, as most appropriate.
These are 1,024 byte kilobytes and 1,024 x 1,024 byte megabytes.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0K 1K ... 1023K 1.0M ... 99.9M 100M ... 2047M</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>SIZENARROW</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the total size, in bytes, of the message.
If a &quot;K&quot; (Kilobyte)
follows the number, the size is approximately 1,000
times that many bytes.
If an &quot;M&quot; (Megabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000 times that many bytes.
If a &quot;G&quot; (Gigabyte) follows the number, the size is approximately
1,000,000,000 times that many bytes.
This field uses only five characters of screen width, including the enclosing
parentheses.
The progression of sizes used looks like:

<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>0 1 ... 999 1K ... 99K .1M ... .9M 1M ... 99M .1G ... .9G 1G 2G</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
</DD>

<DT>DESCRIPSIZE</DT>
<DD>
This token is intended to represent a more useful description of the
message than just its size, but it isn't very useful at this point.
The plus sign in this view means there are attachments.
Note that including this token in
the &quot;Index-Format&quot; could slow down the
display a little while <EM>Pine</EM> collects the necessary information.
</DD>

<DT>ATT</DT>
<DD>
This is a one column wide field which represents the number of attachments
a message has. It will be blank if there are no attachments, a single
digit for one to nine attachments, or an asterisk for more than nine.
Note that including this token in
the &quot;Index-Format&quot; could slow down the
display a little while <EM>Pine</EM> collects the necessary information.
</DD>

<DT>FROMORTO</DT>
<DD>
This token represents <EM>either</EM> the personal name (or email address) of
the person listed in the message's &quot;From:&quot; header
field, <EM>or</EM>, if that address is yours or one of your
<A HREF="#alt-addresses"><EM>alternate addresses</EM></A>,
the first person specified in the
message's &quot;To:&quot; header field
with the prefix &quot;To: &quot; prepended.
If the from address is yours and there is also no &quot;To&quot; address,
<EM>Pine</EM> will use the address on the &quot;Cc&quot; line.
If there is no address there, either, <EM>Pine</EM> will look for a newsgroup name
from the &quot;Newsgroups&quot; header field and put
that after the &quot;To: &quot; prefix.
</DD>

<DT>FROMORTONOTNEWS</DT>
<DD>
This is almost the same as <EM>FROMORTO</EM>.
The difference is that newsgroups aren't considered.
When a message is from you, doesn't have a To or Cc, and does have
a Newsgroups header; this token will be your name instead of the name
of the newsgroup (like it would be with FROMORTO).
</DD>

<DT>SCORE</DT>
<DD>
This gives the score
of each message.
This will be six columns wide to accomodate the widest possible score.
You will probably want to use the index-format fixed-field width feature
to limit the width of the field to the widest score that
you use (e.g. SCORE(3) if your scores are always between 0 and 999).
If you have not defined any score rules the scores will all be zero.
If any of your score rules contain AllText or BodyText patterns
then including SCORE in the index-format
may slow down the display of the MESSAGE INDEX screen.

<DT>CURTIME12</DT>
<DD>
This token represents the current time.
This time is for a 12 hour clock.

<H3><EM>Token Available Only for Templates and Signatures</EM></H3>

<DL>
<DT>CURSORPOS</DT>
<DD>
This token is different from the others.
When it is replaced it is replaced with nothing, but it sets a <EM>Pine</EM>
internal variable which tells the composer to start with the cursor
positioned at the position where this token was.
If both the template file and the signature file contain
a &quot;CURSORPOS&quot; token, then the position in the template file
is used.
If there is a template file and neither it nor the signature file contains
a &quot;CURSORPOS&quot; token, then the cursor is positioned
after the end of the contents of the
template file when the composer starts up.

<H2><A NAME="reply-token-conditionals"></A>Conditional Inclusion of Text for Reply-Leadin, Signatures, and Templates</H2>

Conditional text inclusion may be used with
the <A HREF="#reply-leadin"><EM>Reply-Leadin</EM></A> option,
in signature files, and in template files used in
roles.
It may <EM>not</EM> be used with the
<EM>Index-Format</EM> option.

<P>
There is a limited if-else capability for including text.
The if-else condition is based
on whether or not a given token would result in replacement text you
specify.
The syntax of this conditional inclusion is
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_token_(match_this, if_matched [ , if_not_matched ] )</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The left parenthesis must follow the underscore immediately, with no
intervening space.
It means the token is expanded and the results of that expansion are
compared against the &quot;match_this&quot; argument.
If there is an exact match, then the &quot;if_matched&quot; text is used
as the replacement text.
Otherwise, the &quot;if_not_matched&quot; text is used.
One of the most useful values for the &quot;match_this&quot; argument is
the empty string, &quot;&quot;.
In that case the expansion is compared against the empty string.
<P>
Here's an example to make it clearer.
This text could be included in one of your template files:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;I'm replying to email&quot;,&quot;I'm replying to news&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If that is included in a template file which you are using while replying
to a message (because you chose to use the role it was part of),
and that message has a newsgroup header and a newsgroup in that header,
then the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>I'm replying to news</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
will be included in the message you are about to compose.
On the other hand, if the message you are replying to does not have
a newsgroup, then the text
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>I'm replying to email</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
would be included instead.
This would also work in signature files and in
the &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot; option.
If the &quot;match_this&quot;, &quot;if_matched&quot;,
or &quot;if_not_matched&quot; arguments contain
spaces, parentheses, or commas;
they have to be quoted with double quotation marks (like in the example
above).
If you want to include a literal quote in the text you must escape the
quote by preceding it with a backslash character.
If you want to include a literal backslash character you must escape it
by preceding it with another backslash.
<P>
The comma followed by &quot;if_not_matched&quot; is optional.
If there is no &quot;if_not_matched&quot;
present then no text is included if the not_matched case is true.
Here's another example:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_NEWS_(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;This msg was seen in group: _NEWS_.&quot;)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Here you can see that tokens may appear in the arguments.
The same is true for tokens with the conditional parentheses.
They may appear in arguments,
though you do have to be careful to get the quoting and escaping of
nested double quotes correct.
If this was in the signature file being used and you were replying to a message
sent to comp.mail.pine the resulting text would be:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>This msg was seen in group: comp.mail.pine.</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If you were replying to a message which wasn't sent to any newsgroup the
resulting text would be a single blank line.
The reason you'd get a blank line is because the end of the line is
outside of the conditional, so is always included.
If you wanted to get rid of that blank line you could do so by moving
the end of line inside the conditional.
In other words, it's ok to have multi-line
&quot;if_matched&quot; or &quot;if_not_matched&quot; arguments.
The text just continues until the next double quotation, even if it's not
on the same line.
<P>
Here's one more (contrived) example illustrating a matching argument
which is not the empty string.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_SMARTDATE_("Today", _SMARTDATE_, "On _DATE_") _FROM_ wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this was the value of your &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot; option and you
were replying to
a message which was sent today, then the value of the &quot;Reply-Leadin&quot;
would be
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Today Fred Flintstone wrote:</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
But if you were replying to a message sent on Oct. 27 (and that wasn't
today) you would get
<P>

<H2><A NAME="per-server-ldap-config"></A>Per Server Directory Configuration</H2>

This is only available if <EM>Pine</EM> was linked with an LDAP library
when it was compiled.
If that's the case, there will be a Directory option underneath the Setup
command on the Main Menu.
Each server that is defined there has several configuration variables
which control the behavior when using it.

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> <A NAME="ldap-server"><EM>ldap-server</EM></A>

<DD> This is the name of the host where an LDAP server is running.
<P>
To find out whether your organization has its own LDAP server, 
contact its computing support staff.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="search-base"><EM>search-base</EM></A>

<DD> This is the search base to be used on this server.
It functions as a filter 
by restricting your searches in the LDAP server database
to the specified contents of the specified fields.
Without it, searches submitted to this directory server may fail.
It might be something like:

<PRE>
      O = &lt;Your Organization Name&gt;, C = US
</PRE>

or it might be blank.  
(Some LDAP servers actually ignore anything specified here.)
<P>

If in doubt what parameters you should specify here, 
contact the maintainers of the LDAP server.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="port"><EM>port</EM></A>

<DD> This is the TCP port number to be used with this LDAP server.
If you leave this blank port <CODE>389</CODE> will be used.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="ldap-nickname"><EM>nickname</EM></A>

<DD> This is a nickname to be used in displays.
If you don't supply a nickname the server name from
&quot;ldap-server&quot; will be used instead.
This option is strictly for your convenience.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="use-implicitly-from-composer"><EM>use-implicitly-from-composer</EM></A>

<DD> Set this feature to have lookups done to this server implicitly from
the composer.
If an address doesn't look like a fully-qualified address, it will be looked
up in your address books, and if it doesn't match a nickname there, then it
will be looked up on the LDAP servers which have this feature set.
Also see the LDAP feature
<A HREF="#lookup-addrbook-contents"><EM>lookup-addrbook-contents</EM></A>
and the Setup/Config feature
<A HREF="#ldap-result-to-addrbook-add"><EM>ldap-result-to-addrbook-add</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="lookup-addrbook-contents"><EM>lookup-addrbook-contents</EM></A>

<DD> Normally implicit LDAP lookups from the composer are done only for the
strings you type in from the composer screen. In other words, you type in
something in the To or CC field and press return, then the string is looked up.
First that string is looked up in your address books. If a match is found
there, then the results of that match are looked up again. If you place
a string in your address book that you want to have looked up on the LDAP
directory server, you need to turn on this feature. If you set this feature
for a server, you almost always will also want to set the
<A HREF="#use-implicitly-from-composer"><EM>use-implicitly-from-composer</EM></A>
feature.
An example might serve to best illustrate this feature.
<P>
If an LDAP lookup of &quot;William Clinton&quot; normally returns an
entry with an
address of pres@whitehouse.gov, then you might put an entry in your address
book that looks like:
<PRE>
    Nickname     Address
    bill         &quot;William Clinton&quot;
</PRE>
Now, when you type &quot;bill&quot; into an
address field in the composer <EM>Pine</EM> will
find the &quot;bill&quot; entry in your address book.
It will replace &quot;bill&quot; with
&quot;William Clinton&quot;.
It will then search for an entry with that nickname
in your address book and not find one. If this feature
is set, <EM>Pine</EM> will then attempt to lookup
&quot;William Clinton&quot; on the LDAP server and find the entry with address
pres@whitehouse.gov.
<P>
A better way to accomplish the same thing is probably to use the feature
<A HREF="#save-search-criteria-not-result"><EM>save-search-criteria-not-result</EM></A>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="save-search-criteria-not-result"><EM>save-search-criteria-not-result</EM></A>

<DD> Normally when you save the results of an LDAP directory lookup to your
address book the <EM>results</EM> of the lookup are saved.
If this feature is set
and the entry being saved was found on this directory server, then the
search <EM>criteria</EM> is saved instead of the <EM>results</EM> of the search.
When this address book entry is used in the future, instead of copying
the results from the address book the directory lookup will be done again.
This could be useful if the copied result might become stale because the data on
the directory server changes (for example, the entry's email address changes).
You probably don't want to set this feature if the server is at all slow or
unreliable.
<P>
The way this actually works is that instead of saving the email address
in your address book, <EM>Pine</EM> saves enough
information to look up the same directory entry again.
In particular, it saves the server name and the
distinguished name of the entry.
It's possible that the server administrators
might change the format of distinguished names on the server, or that the
entry might be removed from the server. If <EM>Pine</EM> notices this, you will be warned
and a backup copy of the email address will be used. You may want to create
a new entry in this case, since you will get the annoying warning every
time you use the old entry. You may do that by Saving the entry to a new
nickname in the same address book. You will be asked whether or not you
want to use the backup email address.

<DT> <A NAME="disable-ad-hoc-space-substitution"><EM>disable-ad-hoc-space-substitution</EM></A>

<DD> Spaces in your input are normally handled specially.
Each space character is replaced
by
<PRE>
     * &lt;SPACE&gt;
</PRE>
in the search query (but not by &quot;* &lt;SPACE&gt; *&quot;).
The reason this is done is so the input string
<PRE>
     Greg Donald
</PRE>
(which is converted to &quot;Greg* Donald&quot;) will match
the names &quot;Greg Donald&quot;,
&quot;Gregory Donald&quot;, &quot;Greg F. Donald&quot;, and
&quot;Gregory F Donald&quot;; but it won't match &quot;Greg McDonald&quot;.
If the &quot;Search-Rule&quot; you were using was &quot;begins-with&quot;,
then it would also match the name &quot;Greg Donaldson&quot;.
<P>
Turning on this feature will disable this substitution.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="search-type"><EM>search-type</EM></A>

<DD> This affects the way that LDAP searches are done.
In particular, this tells the server where to look for the string to be matched.
If set to &quot;name&quot; then the string that is being searched for will
be compared with the string in the
&quot;Name&quot; field on the server
(technically, it is the &quot;commonname&quot; field on the server).
&quot;Surname&quot; means we're looking for a
match in the &quot;Surname&quot; field on the
server (actually the &quot;sn&quot; field).
&quot;Givenname&quot; really is &quot;givenname&quot;
and &quot;email&quot; is the electronic mail address (this is actually the field
called &quot;mail&quot; or &quot;electronicmail&quot; on the server).
The other three types are combinations of
the types listed so far. &quot;Name-or-email&quot;
means the string should appear
in either the &quot;name&quot; field OR the &quot;email&quot; field.
Likewise, &quot;surname-or-givenname&quot;
means &quot;surname&quot; OR &quot;givenname&quot;
and &quot;sur-or-given-or-name-or-email&quot; means the obvious thing.
<P>
This search <EM>type</EM> is combined with the
search <A HREF="#search-rule"><EM>rule</EM></A>
to form the actual search query.
<P>
The usual default value for this
option is &quot;sur-or-given-or-name-or-email&quot;.
This type of search may be slow on some servers.
Try &quot;name-or-email&quot;, which is often
faster, or just &quot;name&quot; if the performance seems to be a problem.
<P>
Some servers have been configured with different attribute names for
these four fields.
In other words, instead of using the attribute name &quot;mail&quot;
for the email address field, the server might be configured to use something
else, for example, &quot;rfc822mail&quot; or &quot;internetemailaddress&quot;.
<EM>Pine</EM> can be configured to use these different attribute names by using
the four per-server configuration options:
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="#email-attribute"><EM>email-attribute</EM></A>
</UL>
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="#name-attribute"><EM>name-attribute</EM></A>

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="search-rule"><EM>search-rule</EM></A>

<DD> This affects the way that LDAP searches are done.
If set to &quot;equals&quot; then
only exact matches count.
&quot;Contains&quot; means that the string you type in
is a substring of what you are matching against.
&quot;Begins-with&quot; and &quot;ends-with&quot;
mean that the string starts or ends with the string you type in.
<P>
Spaces in your input are normally handled specially, but you can turn that
special handling off with the
<A HREF="#disable-ad-hoc-space-substitution"><EM>disable-ad-hoc-space-substitution</EM></A>
feature.
<P>
The usual default value for this option is <EM>begins-with</EM>.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="email-attribute"><EM>email-attribute</EM></A>

<DD> This is the name of the attribute which is searched for when looking for
an email address. The default value for this option is &quot;mail&quot; or
&quot;electronicmail&quot;.
If the server you are using uses a different attribute name for the email
address, put that attribute name here.
<P>
This will affect the search filter used if your Search-Type is one that
contains a search for &quot;email&quot;.
It will also cause the attribute value matching this attribute name to be used
as the email address when you look up an entry from the composer.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="name-attribute"><EM>name-attribute</EM></A>

<DD> This is the name of the attribute which is searched for when looking for
the name of the entry. The default value for this option is &quot;cn&quot;, which
stands for common name.
If the server you are using uses a different attribute name for the name,
put that attribute name here.
This will affect the search filter used if your Search-Type is one that
contains a search for &quot;name&quot;.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="surname-attribute"><EM>surname-attribute</EM></A>

<DD> This is the name of the attribute which is searched for when looking for
the surname of the entry. The default value for this option is &quot;sn&quot;.
If the server you are using uses a different attribute name for the surname,
put that attribute name here.
This will affect the search filter used if your Search-Type is one that
contains a search for &quot;surname&quot;.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="givenname-attribute"><EM>givenname-attribute</EM></A>

<DD> This is the name of the attribute which is searched for when looking for
the given name of the entry. The default value for this option is &quot;givenname&quot;.
If the server you are using uses a different attribute name for the given name,
put that attribute name here.
This will affect the search filter used if your Search-Type is one that
contains a search for &quot;givenname&quot;.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="timelimit"><EM>timelimit</EM></A>

<DD> This places a limit on the number of seconds the LDAP search will continue.
The default is 30 seconds. A value of 0 means no limit. Note that some servers
may place limits of their own on searches.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="sizelimit"><EM>sizelimit</EM></A>

<DD> This places a limit on the number of entries returned by the LDAP server.
A value of 0 means no limit. The default is 0. Note that some servers
may place limits of their own on searches.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="custom-search-filter"><EM>custom-search-filter</EM></A>

<DD> This one is for advanced users only! If you define this, then the
<A HREF="#search-type"><EM>search-type</EM></A>
and
<A HREF="#search-rule"><EM>search-rule</EM></A>
defined are both ignored.
However, the feature
<A HREF="#disable-ad-hoc-space-substitution"><EM>disable-ad-hoc-space-substitution</EM></A>
is still in effect.
That is, the space substitution will take place even in a custom filter unless
you disable it.
<P>
If your LDAP service stops working and you suspect it might be because
of your custom filter, just delete this filter and try using the
<EM>search-type</EM> and <EM>search-rule</EM> instead.
Another option that sometimes causes trouble is the
<A HREF="#search-base"><EM>search-base</EM></A> option.
<P>
This variable may be set to the string representation of an LDAP search
filter (see RFC1960). In the places where you want the address string to be
substituted in, put a '%s' in this filter string. Here are some examples:
<P>
A &quot;Search-Type&quot; of &quot;name&quot; with &quot;Search-Rule&quot; of &quot;begins-with&quot;
is equivalent to the &quot;custom-search-filter&quot;
<PRE>
     (cn=%s*)
</PRE>
When you try to match against the string &quot;string&quot; the program replaces
the &quot;%s&quot; with &quot;string&quot; (without the quotes). You may have multiple &quot;%s&quot;'s and
they will all be replaced with the string. There is a limit of 10 &quot;%s&quot;'s.
<P>
A &quot;Search-Type&quot; of &quot;name-or-email&quot; with &quot;Search-Rule&quot;
of &quot;contains&quot; is equivalent to
<PRE>
     (|(cn=*%s*)(mail=*%s*))
</PRE>
<P>
If your server uses a different attribute <EM>name</EM> than
<EM>Pine</EM> uses by default,
(for example, it uses &quot;rfc822mail&quot; instead of &quot;mail&quot;),
then you may be able to use one or more of the four attribute configuration
options instead of defining a custom filter:
<P><UL>
<LI><A HREF="#email-attribute"><EM>email-attribute</EM></A>
</UL>
<P><UL>

<H2><A NAME="color-config"></A>Color Configuration</H2>

If the terminal or terminal emulator you are using is capable of using
color (see <A HREF="#color-style"><EM>color-style</EM></A> option),
or if you are using <EM>PC-Pine</EM>, then it is possible to
set up <EM>Pine</EM> so that various parts of the display will be
shown in colors you configure.
This is done using the Setup Color screen.
The Setup Color screen is divided into four broad sections: Options,
General Colors, Index Colors, and Header Colors.
In addition to these four categories you may also color lines in the
MESSAGE INDEX screen by configuring the
<A HREF="#index-color-config">Index Line Color</A>.
<P>
Each color is defined as a foreground color (the color of the actual text)
and a background color (the color of the area behind the text).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="color-options"></A>Color Options</H3>

<DL>

<DT> <A NAME="cur-il-style"><EM>current-indexline-style</EM></A>
<DD> 
This option affects the colors used to display the current line in the
MESSAGE INDEX screen.
If you do not have
<A HREF="#index-color-config">Index Line Colors</A>
defined, then this option will have no effect.

<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>flip-colors</DT>
<DD>This is the default.
If an index line is colored because it matches one of your
Index Color Rules, then its colors will be reversed when it is the currently
highlighted line.
For example, if the line is normally red text on a blue background, then
when it is the current line it will be drawn as blue text on a red background.
<P>
The rest of the option values all revert to this flip-colors behavior if
there is no Reverse Color defined.
</DD>

<DT>reverse</DT>
<DD>With this option the Reverse color is always used to highlight the
current line.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-fg</DT>
<DD>The foreground part of the Reverse Color is used to highlight
the current line.
If this would cause the text to be unreadable (because the foreground and
background colors are the same) or if it would cause no change in the
color of the index line, then the colors are flipped instead.
<P>
Some people think this works particularly well if you use different
background colors to emphasize &quot;interesting&quot; lines,
but always with the same Normal foreground color,
and you use a different foreground color for the Reverse Color.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-fg-no-ambiguity</DT>
<DD>With the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; rule above, it is possible that
the resulting color will be exactly the same as the regular Reverse
Color.
That can lead to some possible confusion because an
&quot;interesting&quot;
line which is the current line will be displayed exactly the same as a
non-interesting line which is current.
You can't tell whether the line is just a regular current line or if it is
an &quot;interesting&quot; current line by looking at the color.
Setting the option to this value removes that ambiguity.
It is the same as the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; setting unless the resulting
interesting current line would look just like a non-interesting current line.
In that case, the interesting line's colors are simply flipped (like in the
default behavior).
<P>
As an alternative way to preserve the line's interestingness in this case,
you may find that using both a different foreground and a different
background color for the interesting line will help.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-bg</DT>
<DD>The background part of the Reverse Color is used to highlight
the current line.
If this would cause the text to be unreadable (because the foreground and
background colors are the same) or if it would cause no change in the
color of the index line, then the colors are flipped instead.
<P>
Some people think this works particularly well if you use different
foreground colors to emphasize &quot;interesting&quot; lines,
but always with the same Normal background color,
and you use a different background color for the Reverse Color.
</DD>

<DT>reverse-bg-no-ambiguity</DT>
<DD>As with the &quot;reverse-fg&quot; case, the &quot;reverse-bg&quot;
rule may also result in a color which is exactly the same as the regular
Reverse Color.
Setting the option to this value removes that ambiguity.
It is the same as the &quot;reverse-bg&quot; setting unless the resulting
current line has the same color as the Reverse Color.
In that case, the interesting line's colors are simply flipped (like in the
default behavior).
</DD>
</DL>

<DT> <A NAME="titlebar-style"><EM>titlebar-color-style</EM></A>
<DD> 
This option affects the colors used to display the titlebar (the top
line on the screen) when viewing a message.

<P>
The available options include:
<P>

<DL>
<DT>default</DT>
<DD>The color of the titlebar will be the color you set for the
<A HREF="#title-color"><EM>Title Color</EM></A>.
The Title Color may be set by using the
</DD>

<DT>indexline</DT>
<DD>The color of the titlebar will be the same as the color of the
index line corresponding to the message being viewed.
The rules which determine what color the index line will be may be set
up by going to the Setup/Rules/Indexcolor screen.
If the index line for a message is not colored explicitly by the
Indexcolor rules, then the titlebar will be colored the same as for
the &quot;default&quot; option above (which is not the same color that
the index line itself will have).
</DD>

<DT>reverse-indexline</DT>
<DD>This is similar to the &quot;indexline&quot; option except the
foreground and background colors from the corresponding index line will
be reversed.
For example, if the index line color is red letters on a white background,
then the titlebar will be white letters on a red background.
If the index line for a message is not colored explicitly by the
Indexcolor rules, then the titlebar will be colored the same as for
the &quot;default&quot; option above (which is not the same color that
the index line itself will have).

<DD> This is the color which most of the screen is painted in.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="reverse-color"><EM>Reverse Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for reverse video characters.
Actually, the name is misleading. This used to be reverse video and so
the name remains. It is still used to highlight certain parts of the
screen but the color may be set to whatever you'd like.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="title-color"><EM>Title Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for the titlebar (the top line on the
screen).
By default, the Title Color is the same as the Reverse Color.
The actual titlebar color may be different from the Title Color if
the option
<A HREF="#titlebar-color-style"><EM>titlebar-color-style</EM></A>
is set to some value other than default.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="status-color"><EM>Status Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for messages written to the status
message line near the bottom of the screen.
By default, the Status Color is the same as the Reverse Color.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="keylabel-color"><EM>KeyLabel Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for the labels of the commands in the
two-line menu at the bottom of the screen.
The label is the long name, for example, &quot;PrevMsg&quot;.
By default, the KeyLabel Color is the same as the Normal Color.
<P>
WARNING: Some terminal emulators have the property that the screen will scroll
down one line whenever a character is written to the character cell in the
lower right corner of the screen.
<EM>Pine</EM> can usually avoid writing a character in that corner of the screen.
However, if you have defined a KeyLabel Color then <EM>Pine</EM> does have to write
a character in that cell in order to color the cell correctly.
If you find that your display sometimes scrolls up a line this could be
the problem.
The most obvious symptom is probably that the titlebar at the top of the
screen scrolls off the screen.
Try setting KeyLabel Color to Default to see if that fixes the problem.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="keyname-color"><EM>KeyName Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for the names of the commands in the
two-line menu at the bottom of the screen.
The KeyName is the shorter name in the menu. For example, the &quot;W&quot;
before the &quot;WhereIs&quot;.
By default, the KeyName Color is the same as the Normal Color.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="selectable-item-color"><EM>Selectable-item Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for displaying selectable items, such
as URLs.
By default, the Selectable-item Color is the same as the Normal Color, except
it is also Bold.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="quote-colors"><EM>Quote Colors</EM></A>

<DD> The colors <EM>Pine</EM> uses for coloring quoted text in the
MESSAGE TEXT screen.
If a line begins with a &gt; character (or space followed by &gt;) it
is considered a quote. That line will be given the Quote1 Color (first
level quote). If there is a second level of quoting then the Quote2 Color
will be used. <EM>Pine</EM> considers there to be a second level of quoting if
that first &gt; is followed by another &gt; (or space followed by &gt;).
If there are characters other than whitespace and &gt; signs, then it isn't
considered another level of quoting. Similarly, if there is a third level
of quoting the Quote3 Color will be used. If there are more levels after
that the Quote Colors are reused. If you define all three colors then it
would repeat like Color1, Color2, Color3, Color1, Color2, Color3, ...
If you only define the first two it would be Color1, Color2,
Color1, Color2, ...
If you define only the Quote1 Color, then the entire quote would be
that color regardless of the quoting levels.
By default, the Quote Colors are not defined.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="prompt-color"><EM>Prompt Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color <EM>Pine</EM> uses for confirmation prompts and questions
which appear in the status message line near the bottom of the screen.
By default, the Prompt Color is the same as the Reverse Color.
<P>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="index-colors"></A>Index Colors</H3>

You may add color to the single character symbols which give the status
of each message in the MESSAGE INDEX.
By default the characters &quot;+&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, &quot;D&quot;,
&quot;A&quot;, and &quot;N&quot; show up near the left hand side of the
screen, depending on whether the message is addressed to you, and whether
the message is marked Important, is Deleted, is Answered, or is New.
You may set the color of those symbols.
By default, all of these symbols are drawn with the same color as the rest
of the index line they are a part of.
<P>
Besides coloring the message status symbols, you may also color the
entire index line.
This is done by using the
<A HREF="#index-color-config">Index Line Color</A> configuration screen.
<P>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> <A NAME="index-to-me-color"><EM>Index-to-me Symbol Color</EM></A>

message is addressed directly to you.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-important-color"><EM>Index-important Symbol Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color used for drawing the &quot;*&quot; symbol which signifies a
message has been flagged Important.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-deleted-color"><EM>Index-deleted Symbol Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color used for drawing the &quot;D&quot; symbol which signifies a

<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-answered-color"><EM>Index-answered Symbol Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color used for drawing the &quot;A&quot; symbol which signifies a

<DD> The color used for drawing the &quot;N&quot; symbol which signifies a
message is New.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-recent-color"><EM>Index-recent Symbol Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color used for drawing the &quot;R&quot; symbol which signifies a
message is Recent (only visible if the &quot;IMAPSTATUS&quot; token is
part of the
<A HREF="#index-format"><EM>index-format</EM></A> option).
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="index-unseen-color"><EM>Index-unseen Symbol Color</EM></A>

<DD> The color used for drawing the &quot;U&quot; symbol which signifies a
message is Unseen (only visible if the &quot;IMAPSTATUS&quot; token is
part of the
<A HREF="#index-format"><EM>index-format</EM></A> option).
<P>

</DL>

<H3><A NAME="header-colors"></A>Header Colors</H3>

You may add color to the header fields in the MESSAGE TEXT screen.
For example, you may set the color of the contents of the Subject field
or the From field.
<P>
For Header Colors,
there is an additional line on the configuration
screen labeled &quot;Pattern to match&quot;.
If you leave that blank, then the whole field for that header will
always be colored.
However, if you give a pattern to match, the coloring will only take place
if there is a match for that pattern in the value of the field.
For example, if you are working on a color for the Subject header and
you fill in a pattern of &quot;important&quot;, then only Subjects which
contain the word &quot;important&quot; will be colored.
For address fields like From or To, a pattern match will cause only the
addresses which match the pattern to be colored.
<P>
If the pattern you enter is a comma-separated list of patterns, then coloring
happens if any of those patterns matches.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="index-line-colors"></A>Index Line Colors</H3>

You may color whole index lines by using roles.
This isn't configured in the Setup Colors screen, but is configured in
the <A HREF="#index-color-config">Setup Rules IndexColor</A> screen.

<H2><A NAME="index-color-config"></A>Index Line Color Configuration</H2>

Index Line Color causes lines in the MESSAGE INDEX screen to be colored.
This action is only available if your terminal is capable of displaying
color and color display has been enabled with the
<A HREF="#color-style"><EM>Color-Style</EM></A> option.
(In PC-Pine, color is always enabled so there is no option to turn on.)
<P>
Each rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot;,
which is used to decide which of the rules is used; and the color which
is used if the Pattern matches a particular message.

<H3>Rule Patterns</H3>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a rule the message is
compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
and Scoring, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="#patterns-section">here</A>&quot;.

<H3>Index Line Color</H3>

This is the color that index lines are colored when there is a matching
Pattern.
This colors the whole index line, except possibly the status letters
which may be colored separately using
the <A HREF="#color-config">Setup Kolor</A> screen.

<H2><A NAME="role-config"></A>Role Configuration</H2>

You may play different roles depending on who you are replying to.
For example, if you are replying to a message addressed to <EM>help-desk</EM> you
may be acting as a Help Desk Worker.
That role may require that you use a different return address and/or
a different signature.
<P>
Roles are optional.
If you set up roles they work like this:  Each role has a set of
&quot;Uses&quot;, which indicate whether or not a role is eligible to be
considered for a particular use; a &quot;Pattern&quot;,
which is used to decide which of the eligible roles is used; and a set
of &quot;Actions&quot;, which are taken when that role is used.
When you reply to a message, the message you are replying to is compared
with the Patterns of the roles marked as eligible for use when replying.
The comparisons start with the first eligible role and keep going until there
is a match.
If a match is found, the matching role's Actions are taken.

<H3>Role Uses</H3>

There are three types of use to be configured;
one for Replying, one for Forwarding, and one for Composing.
These indicate whether or not you want a role to be considered when you
type the Reply, Forward, or Compose commands.
(The Role command is an alternate form of the Compose command, and it is
not affected by these settings.)
Each of these Use types has three possible values.
The value &quot;Never&quot;
means that the role will never be considered as a candidate for use with
the corresponding command.
For example, if you set a role's Reply Use to Never, then when you Reply to
a message, the role won't even be considered.
(That isn't quite true. If the message you are replying to matches some other
role which requires confirmation,
then there will be a ^T command available which allows you to select a role
from all of your roles, not just the reply-eligible roles.)
<P>

The options &quot;With confirmation&quot; and &quot;Without confirmation&quot;
both mean that you do want to consider this role when using the corresponding
command.
For either of these settings the role's Pattern will
be checked to see if it matches the message.
For Reply Use, the message used to compare the Patterns with is the message
being replied to.
For Forward Use, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being forwarded.
For Compose Use, there is no message, so the parts of the Pattern which depend
on a message (everything other than Current Folder Type) are ignored.
In all cases, the Current Folder is checked if defined.
If there is a match then this role will either be used without confirmation
or will be the default when confirmation is asked for, depending on
which of the two options is selected.
If confirmation is requested, you will have a chance to
choose No Role instead of the offered role, or to
change the role to any one of your other roles (with the ^T command).

<H3>Role Patterns</H3>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a role the message is
compared with the Role Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
and Scoring, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="#patterns-section">here</A>&quot;.
<P>
Since header patterns, AllText patterns, and BodyText patterns which are unset are ignored,
a role which has all header patterns unset, the AllText pattern unset,
the BodyText pattern unset,
the Score Interval unset, and the Current Folder Type set to
&quot;Any&quot; may be used as a default role.
It should be put last in the list of roles since the matching
starts at the beginning and proceeds until one of the roles is a match.
If no roles at all match, then <EM>Pine</EM> will
use its regular methods of defining the role.
If you wanted to, you could define a different &quot;default&quot; role
for Replying, Forwarding, and Composing by setting the
&quot;Use&quot; fields appropriately.

<H3>Role Actions</H3>

Once a role match is found, the role's Actions are taken.
For each role there are several possible actions that may be defined.
They are actions to set the From address, the Reply-To address,
the Fcc, the Signature file, and the Template file.

<H4>Initialize Setttings Using Role</H4>

This is a power user feature.
You will usually want to leave this field empty.
The value of this field is the nickname of another one of your roles.
The action values from that other role
are used as the initial values of the action items for this role.
If you put something in any of the action fields for this role, that will
override whatever was in the corresponding field of the initializer role.
The fields affected by this field are the fields labeled
&quot;Set From&quot;,
&quot;Set Reply-To&quot;,
&quot;Set Other Headers&quot;,
&quot;Set Fcc&quot;,
&quot;Set LiteralSig&quot;,
&quot;Set Signature&quot;,
&quot;Set Template&quot;, and
&quot;Use SMTP Server&quot;.
<P>
You might use this field if the &quot;action&quot; part of one of your roles
is something you want to use in more than one role.
Instead of filling in those action values again for each role, you
may give the nickname of the role where the values are filled in.
It's just a shortcut way to define role actions.
<P>
Here's an example to help explain how this works.
Suppose you have a role with nickname &quot;role1&quot; and role1 has
(among other things)
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Signature = sig_file1</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
set.
If in &quot;role2&quot; you set &quot;Initialize settings using role&quot; to
&quot;role1&quot;, then role2 will inherit the Set Signature value
from role1 by default (and any of the three other action values that are set).
So if role2 had
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Signature =</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
defined, the signature file used with role2 would be &quot;sig-file1&quot;.
However, if role2 had
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Signature = sig_file2</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
defined, then the signature file used with role2 would be &quot;sig-file2&quot;.
<P>
If you wish,
you may choose a nickname from your list of roles by using the
&quot;T&quot; command.

<H4>Set From</H4>

This field consists of a single address which will be used as the From
address on the message you are sending.
This should be a fully-qualified address like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Full Name &lt;user@domain&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>user@domain</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this is left blank, then the normal From address will be used.

<H4>Set Reply-To</H4>

The Reply-To address is the address used on the Reply-To line of the message
you are sending.
You don't need a Reply-To address unless it is different from the From address.
This should be a fully-qualified address like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Full Name &lt;user@domain&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or just
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>user@domain</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
If this is left blank, then there won't be a Reply-To address unless
you have configured one specially with the
<A HREF="#cust-hdr"><EM>customized-hdrs</EM></A>
configuration option.

<H4>Set Other-Hdrs</H4>

This field gives you a way to set values for headers besides
&quot;From&quot; and &quot;Reply-To&quot;.
If you want to set either of those, use the specific
&quot;Set From&quot; and &quot;Set Reply-To&quot; settings.
<P>
This field is similar to the
<A HREF="#cust-hdr"><EM>customized-hdrs</EM></A> option.
Each header you specify here must include the header tag 
(&quot;To:&quot;, &quot;Approved:&quot;, etc.)
and may optionally include a value for that header.
In order to see these headers when you compose using this role you 
must use the rich header command.
Here's an example which shows how you might set the To address.
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>Set Other Hdrs = To: Full Name &lt;user@domain&gt;</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Headers set in this way are different from headers set with the
customized-hdrs option in that the value you give for a header here
will replace any value that already exists.
For example, if you are Replying to a message there will already be at
least one address in the To header (the address you are Replying to).
However, if you Reply using a role which sets the To header, that role's
To header value will be used instead.
The customized-hdrs headers are defaults.
<P>
Limitation: Because commas are used to separate the list of
Other Headers, it is not possible to have the value of a
header contain a comma;
nor is there currently an &quot;escape&quot; mechanism provided
to make this work.

<H4>Set Fcc</H4>

This field consists of a single folder name which will be used in
the Fcc field of the message you are sending.
You may put anything here that you would normally type into the Fcc
field from the composer.
<P>
In addition, an fcc of &quot;&quot; (two double quotation marks) means
no Fcc.
<P>
A blank field here means that <EM>Pine</EM> will use its normal rules for deciding
the default value of the Fcc field.
For many roles, perhaps most, it may make more sense for you to use the
other <EM>Pine</EM> facilities for setting the Fcc.
In particular, if you want the Fcc to depend on who you are sending the
message to then the <A HREF="#fcc-name-rule"><EM>fcc-name-rule</EM></A>
is probably more useful.
In that case, you would want to leave the Fcc field here blank.
However, if you have a role that depends on who the message you are replying
to was From, or what address that message was sent to;
then it might make sense to set the Fcc for that role here.

<H4>Set LiteralSig</H4>

This field contains the actual text for your signature, as opposed to
the name of a file containing your signature.
If this is defined it takes precedence over any value set in the
<EM>Set Signature</EM> field.
<P>
This is simply a different way to store the signature.
The signature is stored inside your Pine configuration file instead of in
a separate signature file.
Tokens work the same way they do with <EM>Set Signature</EM>.
<P>

The two character sequence &#92;n (backslash followed by
the character n) will be used to signify a line-break in your signature.
You don't have to enter the &#92;n, but it will be visible in the
CHANGE THIS ROLE RULE window after you are done editing the signature.

<H4>Set Signature</H4>

The Signature is the name of a file to be used as the signature file when
this role is being used.
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program which will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from <EM>Pine</EM>,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.

<P>
Signature files may be stored remotely on an IMAP server.
In order to do that you just give the file a remote name.
This works just like the regular
<A HREF="#sig-file">signature-file</A>
option which is configured from the Setup/Configuration screen.
A remote signature file name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/sig3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or, if you have an SSL-capable version of <EM>Pine</EM>, you might try
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us/user=loginname/ssl}mail/sig3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Once you have named the remote signature file you create its
contents by using the &quot;F&quot; &quot;editFile&quot; command when the
cursor is on the &quot;Set Signature&quot;
line of the role editor.

<P>
Besides containing regular text, a signature file may also
contain (or a signature program may produce) tokens which are replaced with text
which depends on the message you are replying to or forwarding.
The tokens all look like _word_ (a word surrounded by underscores).
For example, if the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is included in the text of the signature file, then when you reply to
or forward a message, the token will be replaced with the actual date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
<P>
If you use a role which has a signature file for a plain composition
(that is, not a reply or forward) then there is no original message, so
any tokens which depend on the message will be replaced with nothing.
So if you want a signature file to be useful for new compositions it
shouldn't include any of the tokens which depend on the message being
replied to or forwarded.
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="#index-tokens">here</A>.
<P>
Actually, for the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="#reply-token-conditionals">here</A>.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token in
a signature file, you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example, to include the literal text _DATE_ you must actually use
&#92;_DATE_.
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
A blank field here means that <EM>Pine</EM> will use its normal rules for deciding
which file (if any) to use for the signature file.

<H4>Set Template</H4>

A Template is the name of a file to be included in the message when this
role is being used.
The template file is a file which is included at the top of the message you
are composing.
<P>
If the filename is followed by a vertical bar (|) then instead
of reading the contents of the file the file is assumed to be a
program which will produce the text to be used on its standard output.
The program can't have any arguments and doesn't receive any input from <EM>Pine</EM>,
but the rest of the processing works as if the contents came from a file.
<P>
Template files may be stored remotely on an IMAP server.
In order to do that you just give the file a remote name.
This works just like the regular
<A HREF="#sig-file">signature-file</A>
option which is configured from the Setup/Configuration screen.
A remote template file name might look like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us}mail/templ3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
or, if you have an SSL-capable version of <EM>Pine</EM>, you might try
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{myimaphost.myschool.k12.wa.us/user=loginname/ssl}mail/templ3</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
Once you have named the remote template file you create its
contents by using the &quot;F&quot; &quot;editFile&quot; command when the
cursor is on the &quot;Set Template&quot;
line of the role editor.
<P>
Besides containing regular text, a template file may also
contain (or a template file program may produce) tokens which are replaced with text
which depends on the message you are replying to or forwarding.
The tokens all look like _word_ (a word surrounded by underscores).
For example, if the token
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>_DATE_</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
is included in the text of the template file, then when you reply to
or forward a message, the token will be replaced with the actual date
the message you are replying to or forwarding was sent.
<P>
If you use a role which has a template file for a plain composition
(that is, not a reply or forward) then there is no original message, so
any tokens which depend on the message will be replaced with nothing.
So if you want a template file to be useful for new compositions it
shouldn't include any of the tokens which depend on the message being
replied to or forwarded.
<P>
The list of available tokens is
<A HREF="#index-tokens">here</A>.
<P>
Actually, for the adventurous, there is a way to conditionally include text based
on whether or not a token would result in specific replacement text.
For example, you could include some text based on whether or not
the _NEWS_ token would result in any newsgroups if it was used.
It's explained in detail
<A HREF="#reply-token-conditionals">here</A>.
<P>
In the very unlikely event that you want to include a literal token in
a template file, you must precede it with a backslash character.
For example, to include the literal text _DATE_ you must actually use
&#92;_DATE_.
It is not possible to have a literal backslash followed by an expanded token.
<P>
A blank field here means that <EM>Pine</EM> will not use a template file when
this role is being used.

<H4>Use SMTP Server</H4>

If this field has a value, then it will be used as the SMTP server
to send mail when this role is being used (unless the SMTP server variable
is set in the system-wide fixed configuration file).
It has the same semantics as the
<A HREF="#smtp-server"><EM>smtp-server</EM></A>
variable in the Setup/Config screen.
When you postpone the composition this SMTP server list will be saved
with the postponed composition and it cannot be changed later.
Because of that, you may want to make this a list of SMTP servers
with the preferred server at the front of the list and alternate servers
later in the list.

<P>
If any of the actions are left unset, then the action depends on what
is present in the &quot;Initialize settings using role&quot; field.
If you've listed the nickname of another one of your roles there, then the
corresponding action from that role will be used here.
If that action is also blank, or if there is no nickname specified,
then <EM>Pine</EM> will do whatever it normally does to set these actions.
This depends on other configuration options and features you've set.

<H2><A NAME="filter-config"></A>Filtering Configuration</H2>

The software which actually delivers mail (the stuff that happens
before <EM>Pine</EM> is involved) for you is in a better position to do mail filtering
than <EM>Pine</EM> itself.
If possible, you may want to look into using that sort of mail filtering to
deliver mail to different folders, delete it, or forward it.
However, if you'd like <EM>Pine</EM> to help with this, <EM>Pine</EM>'s filtering is for you.
<P>
Filtering is a way to automatically move certain messages from one folder
to another or to delete messages.
It can also be used to set message status bits (Important, Deleted, New,
Answered).
<EM>Pine</EM> doesn't have the ability to forward mail to another address.
<P>
Each filtering rule has a &quot;Pattern&quot; and a &quot;Filter Action&quot;.
When a folder is opened, when new mail arrives in an open folder, or
when mail is Expunged from a folder; each
message is compared with the Patterns of your filtering rules.
The comparisons start with the first rule and keep going until there
is a match.
If a match is found, the message may be deleted or moved, depending on
the setting of the Filter Action.
If the message is not deleted, it may have its status altered.
<P>
For efficiency, each message is usually only checked once.
When new mail arrives, the new messages are checked but not the old.
There are some exceptions to this rule.
The expunge command will cause all messages to be rechecked, as will
editing of the filtering rules.

<P>
<EM>NOTE:</EM>
When setting up a Pattern used to delete messages,
it is recommended that you test the Pattern first with a &quot;Move&quot;
folder specified in
case unintended matches occur.  Messages that are deleted will be removed 
from the folder and <EM>unrecoverable</EM> from within <EM>Pine</EM> after the
next Expunge command or once the folder being filtered has been closed.

<H3>Filter Patterns</H3>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a filter the message is
compared with the Filter's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="#patterns-section">here</A>&quot;.
<P>
Since filtering is a potentially destructive action, if you have a filtering
Pattern with nothing other than Current Folder Type set, that filtering
rule is ignored.

<H3>Filter Actions</H3>

Once a filter match is found for a particular message, there are some actions
which may be taken.
First, the message may have its status changed.
This is the same message status that you can manipulate manually using the
Flag Command.
There are four elements of message status that you can control.
You can set or clear the Important status, the New status, the Deleted
status, and the Answered status.
Of course, if the filter is going to delete the message,
then there is no point in setting message status.
<P>
Second, the filter may delete or move the message.
Deleting the message marks it Deleted and removes it from view.
It is effectively gone forever (though it technically is still there until
the next expunge command, which may happen implicitly).
Moving the message moves it from the open folder into the folder
listed on the &quot;to Folder&quot; line of the filter configuration.
If you list more than one folder name (separated by commas) then the message
will be copied to each of those folders.
In any case, if &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;Move&quot; is set then the
message is removed from the current folder.
If you just want to set the messages status without deleting it from
the folder, then set the filter action to
&quot;Just Set Message Status&quot;.
<P>
(There is no way to do a Copy instead of a Move, due to the difficulties
involved in keeping track of whether or not a message has
already been copied.)

<H4><A NAME="move-only-if-not-deleted"></A>Move-only-if-not-deleted option</H4>

If you have specified a Move to Folder to filter messages into, then this
option has an effect.
If this option is set then messages will only be moved into the specified folder
if they aren't already marked deleted.
This might be useful if you have more than one <EM>Pine</EM> session running
simultaneously and you don't want messages to be filtered into a folder
more than once.
This method is not foolproof.
There may be cases where a message gets marked deleted and so it is never
filtered into the folder.
For example, if you deleted it in another <EM>Pine</EM> or
another mail program that didn't know about the filtering rule.
<P>
This option has no effect if the Filter Action is not set to Move.

<H4><A NAME="dont-quit-even-if-rule-matches"></A>Dont-quit-even-if-rule-matches option</H4>

If this option is set then this is a non-terminating rule.
Usually, for each message, <EM>Pine</EM> searches through the filter rules until
a match is found and then it performs the action associated with that rule.
Rules following the match are not considered.
If this option is set then the search for matches will continue at the next
rule.
<P>
If a non-terminating rule matches then the actions associated with
that rule, except for any implied deletion of the message, are performed
before the match for the next rule is checked.
For example, if the non-terminating rule sets the Important status, then that
status will be set when the next rule is considered.
However, if the non-terminating rule Moves the message, the message will
actually be copied instead of copied and deleted so that it is still there
for the next rule.
A moved message is deleted after all the relevant rules have been checked.
The name of the &quot;Move&quot; action is confusing in this case because
a single message can be moved to more than one folder.
It turns the Move into a Copy instead, but it is still followed by a deletion
at the end.
<P>
This option may be useful if you want to have a single message filtered to
two different folders because it matches two different Patterns.
For example, suppose you normally filter messages to a particular mailing
list into one folder, and messages addressed directly to you into a second
folder.
If a message is sent to both you and the list (and you can tell that by
looking at the headers of the message) this option may give you a convenient
way to capture a copy to each folder.
(It may also cause you to capture two copies to each folder,
depending on whether your mail system delivers one or two copies of the
message to you and on how the list works.)

<H2><A NAME="scoring-config"></A>Scoring Configuration</H2>

Most people will not use scores at all, but if you do use them, here's how
they work in Pine.
Using this screen, you may define Scoring rules.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every Score rule defined
and adding up the Score Values for the ones which match the message.
If there are no matches for a message, it has a score of zero.
Message scores may be used a couple of ways in Pine.

<H3>Sorting by Score</H3>

One of the methods you may use to sort message indexes is to sort by
score.
The scores of all the messages in a folder will be calculated and then
the index will be ordered by placing the messages in order of ascending or
descending score.

<H3>Scores for use in Patterns</H3>

The Patterns used for Roles, Index Line Coloring, and Filtering have a
category labeled &quot;Score Interval&quot;.
When a message is being compared with a Pattern to check for a match, if
the Score Interval is set only messages which have a score somewhere in
the interval are a match.

<H3>Scoring Rule Patterns</H3>

In order to determine whether or not a message matches a scoring rule
the message is compared with the rule's Pattern.
These Patterns are the same for use with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
and Scoring, so are described in only one place,
&quot;<A HREF="#patterns-section">here</A>&quot;.

<P>
Actually, Scoring rule Patterns are slightly different from the other types of
Patterns because Scoring rule Patterns don't contain a Score Interval.
In other words, when calculating the score for a message, which is done
by looking at the Scoring rule Patterns, scores aren't used.

<H3>Score Value</H3>

This is the value that will be added to the score for a message if the
rule's Pattern is a match.
Each individual Score Value is an integer between -100 and 100, and the
values from matching rules are added together to get a message's score.

<H2><A NAME="other-config"></A>Other Rules Configuration</H2>

Using this screen, you may define configuration Rules which don't fit
nicely into the other Rules categories.

<H3>Other Rule Patterns</H3>

Other Rules are a little different from the rest of the Rules because
they depend only on the current folder, and not on a particular message.
In order to determine whether or not a rule's actions should be applied
the current folder is compared with the rule's Pattern, which consists
of only the Current Folder Type.
Current Folder Type works the same for Other Rules as it does for Roles,
Filtering, Index Coloring, and Scoring.
Keep in mind that the only part of the Pattern which applies to Other
Rules is the Current Folder Type when looking at the description of
Patterns given
&quot;<A HREF="#patterns-section">here</A>&quot;.

<H3>Other Rule Actions</H3>

Once a pattern match is found, the rule's Actions are taken.
Neither of the following two rule's depends on a message for its match.
That means that all the parts of the Pattern which depend on matching an
attribute of a message are ignored.
So the only part of the Pattern that matters for these Actions is
the Current Folder Type.

<H4>Set Sort Order</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set a sort order which is different from your default sort order.
The default is set in the Setup/Config screen with
the <A HREF="#sort-key">Sort-Key</A> option.
If the Sort Order action is set, then the folder will be displayed sorted in
that sort order instead of in the default order.
<P>
A possible point of confusion arises when you change the configuration
of the Sort Order for the currently open folder.
The folder will normally be re-sorted when you go back to viewing the
index.
However, if you have manually sorted the folder with the
Sort command, it will not be re-sorted.

<H4>Set Index Format</H3>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set an Index Format which is different from your default Index Format,
which is set with the
<A HREF="#index-format"><EM>Index-Format</EM></A> option.
If so, the index will be displayed with this format instead of the default.

<H4>Set Startup Rule</H4>

When you enter a new folder, these rules will be checked to see if you
have set a startup rule which is different from the default startup rule.
The default for incoming folders is set in the Setup/Config screen with
the &quot;incoming-startup-rule&quot; option.
The default for folders other than INBOX that are not part of your
incoming collection
(see <A HREF="#enable-incoming-folders">enable-incoming-folders</A> feature)
is to start with the last message in the folder.
If the Startup Rule is set to something other than &quot;default&quot;,
then the rule will determine which message will be the current message when
the folder is first opened.
<P>
The various startup rule possibilities work the same here as they do in
the incoming collection, except that the folder can be any specific
folder or any folder type.

<H2><A NAME="patterns-section"></A>Patterns</H2>

Patterns are used with Roles, Filtering, Index Coloring,
Scoring, and Other Rules.
Patterns are compared with a message to see if there is a match.
For Filtering, the messages being checked are all the messages in the
folder, one at a time.
For Index Line Coloring, each message which is visible on the screen is
checked for matches with the Index Coloring Patterns.
Roles are used with the Reply, Forward, and Compose commands.
For Reply, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being replied to;
for Forward, the message used to compare the Pattern with is the message
being forwarded;
and for Compose, there is no message, so the parts of the Pattern which depend
on a message (everything other than Current Folder Type)
are not used.
Only the Current Folder Type matters for Compose.
For Scoring, the message being scored is compared with all of the Score
Patterns, and the Score Values from the ones that match are added together to 
get the message's score.
For Other Rules, there is no message. Only the Current Folder Type is checked
for Other Rules.
<P>
Each Pattern has several possible parts, all of which are optional.
In order for there to be a match, <EM>ALL</EM> of the
<EM>defined</EM> parts of the Pattern must match the message.
If a part is not defined it is considered a match.
For example, if the To pattern is not defined it will be
displayed as
<P>
<CENTER>To pattern = &lt;No Value Set&gt;</CENTER>
<P>
That is considered a match because it is not defined.
This means that the Pattern with nothing defined is a match if the
Current Folder Type matches, but there is an exception.
Because filtering is a potentially destructive action, filtering Patterns
with nothing other than Current Folder Type defined are ignored.
If you really want a filtering Pattern to match all messages (subject to
Current Folder Type) the best way to do it is to define a Score interval
which includes all possible scores.
This would be the score interval (-INF,INF).
This can be used even if you haven't defined any rules to Set Scores.
<P>
There are six predefined header patterns called the To, From, Sender, Cc, News,
and Subject patterns.
Besides those six predefined header patterns, you may add
additional header patterns with header fieldnames of your choosing.
You add an extra header pattern by placing the cursor on one of the
patterns while in the role editor and using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command.
The Recip pattern is a header pattern which stands for Recipient (To OR Cc)
and the Partic pattern is a header pattern which stands for
Participant (From OR To OR Cc).
(Defining the Recip pattern does not have the same effect as defining both
the To and Cc patterns. Recip is To <EM>OR</EM> Cc, not To <EM>AND</EM> Cc.)
Similar to the header patterns are the AllText pattern and the BodyText pattern.
Instead of comparing this pattern's text against only the contents of
a particular header field, the text for the AllText pattern is compared
with text anywhere in the message's header or body, and the text for the
BodyText pattern is compared with text anywhere in the message's body.
<P>
Any of the header patterns, the AllText pattern, or the BodyText pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
That is, if the pattern matches then it is considered to NOT be a match, and
if it does not match it is considered to be a match.
<P>
The contents of each of these header patterns (or the AllText or BodyText patterns) may
be a complete email address, part of an address, or a random set of
characters to match against.
It may also be a comma-separated list of such patterns, which means you
are looking for a match against the first pattern in the list <EM>OR</EM>
the second pattern <EM>OR</EM> the third and so on.
For example, a Subject pattern equal to
<P>
<PRE>
 Subject pattern = urgent, emergency, alert
</PRE>
<P>
would match all messages with a subject which contained at least one
of those words.
It would also match subjects containing the words &quot;alerts&quot; or
&quot;Urgently&quot;.
<P>
The same example with &quot;NOT&quot; turned on would be
<P>
<PRE>
 ! Subject pattern = urgent, emergency, alert
</PRE>
<P>
which would match all messages with a subject which did NOT contain any of
those words.
<P>
(It is not possible to specify two patterns which must <EM>BOTH</EM> be
present for a match.
It is only possible to specify that <EM>EITHER</EM> pattern1 <EM>OR</EM>
pattern2 must be present,
and that is exactly what the comma-separated list does.)
<P>
The &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; and the &quot;Score Interval&quot; are
also part of the Pattern, although the &quot;Score Interval&quot; is not used
when checking for matches for Scoring.
There are five similar settings which relate to the status of the message.
These settings rely on the message being New or not, Deleted or not,
Answered or not, Important or not, and Recent or not.
There are also three more specialized settings.
The first is the Age of the message in days.
The second is a setting which detects whether or not the Subject of a
message contains raw 8-bit characters (unencoded characters with the most
significant bit set) .
And the third is a setting which detects whether or not the From address of a
message appears in your address book.

<H3>Parts of a Pattern</H3>

<H4>Header patterns</H4>

A header pattern is simply text which is searched for in the corresponding
header field.
For example, if a Pattern has a From header pattern with the value
&quot;@company.com&quot;, then only messages which have a From header
which contains the text &quot;@company.com&quot; will be possible
matches.
Matches don't have to be exact.
For example, if the relevant field of a message contains the text
&quot;mailbox@domain&quot; somewhere
in it, then header patterns of &quot;box&quot;, or &quot;x@d&quot;, or
&quot;mailbox@domain&quot; are all matches.
<P>
All parts of the Pattern must match so, for example,
if a message matches a defined
From pattern, it still must be checked against the other parts of the
Pattern which have been defined.
The To header pattern is a slightly special case.
If the message being checked has a Resent-To header, the addresses
there are used in place of the addresses in the To header.
This is only true for the To header.
Resent-cc and Resent-From headers are never used unless you add them
with the eXtraHdrs command.
<P>
The meaning of a header pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
<P>
If you want to check for the presence of a header field but don't care
about its value, then
the empty pattern which you get by entering a pair of
double quotes (&quot;&quot;) should match any message which
has the corresponding header field.

<H4><A NAME="pattern_alltext">AllText patterns</A></H4>

AllText patterns are just like header patterns except that the text is
searched for anywhere in the message's headers or body, not just in the
contents of a particular header field.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="pattern_bodytext">BodyText patterns</A></H3>

BodyText patterns are just like header patterns except that the text is
searched for anywhere in the message's body, not just in the
contents of a particular header field.
<P>

If there is more than one header pattern or AllText pattern or BodyText pattern
for which you want to take the
same action there is a shorthand notation which may be used.
Any of these patterns may be a comma-separated list of patterns instead of
just a single pattern.
If any one of the patterns in the list matches the message
then it is considered a match.
For example, if &quot;company1&quot; and &quot;company2&quot; both required
you to use the same role when replying to messages, you might have
a To pattern which looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>company1.com,company2.com</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
This means that if the mail you are replying to was addressed to
either &quot;anything@company1.com&quot; or &quot;anything@company2.com&quot;,
then this Pattern is a match and the same actions will be taken.
<P>
The meaning of an AllText or BodyText pattern may be negated with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
You can tell that <EM>NOT</EM> has been turned on by looking for the character
&quot;!&quot; at the beginning of the pattern line.
When the &quot;!&quot; is present, it reverses the meaning of the match.
<P>
A technicality: Since comma is the character used to separate multiple values
in a header, AllText, or BodyText pattern field, you have to escape comma with a
backslash (&#92;) if you want to include a literal comma in one of those fields.
The same is true for the backslash character itself, which must be escaped
with another backslash to make it literal.
It's unlikely you'll ever need to enter a literal comma or backslash in
any of the patterns.

<H4>Current Folder Type</H4>

The &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; may be set to one of four different
values: &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;, or
&quot;Specific&quot;.
If the value is set to &quot;News&quot;, then the
Pattern will only match if the currently open folder is a newsgroup.
The value &quot;Email&quot; only matches if the current folder is not news and
the value &quot;Any&quot; causes any folder to match.
If the value of &quot;Current Folder Type&quot; is set to &quot;Specific&quot;,
then you must fill in a value for &quot;Folder&quot;, which is on the line
below the &quot;Specific&quot; line.
In this case you will only get a match if the currently open folder is
the specific folder you list.
You may give a comma-separated list of folders instead of just a single
folder name, in which case the Pattern will match if the open folder is
any one of the folders in the list.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;,
the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are some samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.nowhere.edu}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.myisp.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>mail/local-folder</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder&quot; field is to use
the &quot;T&quot; command which is available when the &quot;Folder&quot; line is
hilighted, or to use the &quot;Take&quot; command with the configuration
feature
<A HREF="#enable-rules-under-take">&quot;enable-rules-under-take&quot;</A>
turned on.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check whether
or not a Pattern matches a message.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.
If you have Patterns with a Current Folder Type of either
&quot;Any&quot; or &quot;News&quot; and those Patterns are used for
Index Line Coloring or Scoring, you may experience
slower screen redrawing in the MESSAGE INDEX screen when in a newsgroup.

<H4>Age Interval</H4>

The &quot;Age Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
ages which should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Age Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_age,max_age)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_age&quot; and &quot;max_age&quot; are integers greater
than or equal to zero.
The special value &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the max value. It represents infinity.
<P>
When there is an Age Interval defined, it is a match if the age, in days, of
the message is contained in the interval.
The interval includes both endpoints.
<P>
Even though this option is called Age, it isn't actually
the <EM>age</EM> of the message.
Instead, it is how many days ago the message arrived in one of your folders.
If the current time is a little past midnight, then a message that arrived
just before midnight arrived yesterday, even though the message is only
a few minutes old.
By default, the date being used is not the date in the Date
header of the message.
It is the date that the message arrived in one of your folders.
When you Save a message from one folder to another that arrival date
is preserved.
If you would like to use the date in the Date header that is possible.
Turn on the option
<EM>use-date-header-for-age</EM>
near the bottom of the rule definition.
<P>
A value of 0 is today, 1 is yesterday, 2 is the day before yesterday, and so on.

<H4>Score Interval</H4>

The &quot;Score Interval&quot; may be set to an interval of message
scores which should be considered a match.
Like the other parts of the Pattern, if it is unset it will be ignored.
The Score Interval looks like
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_score,max_score)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_score&quot; and &quot;max_score&quot; are integers between
-32000 and 32000.
The special values &quot;-INF&quot; and &quot;INF&quot; may be used for
the min and max values to represent negative and positive infinity.
<P>
When there is a Score Interval defined, it is a match if the score for
the message is contained in the interval.
The interval includes both endpoints.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every Score rule defined and
adding up the Score Values for the ones which match the message.
When deciding whether or not a Pattern matches a message for purposes of
calculating the score, the Score Interval is ignored.

<H4>Message Status</H4>

There are five separate message status settings.
By default, all five are set to the value &quot;Don't care&quot;, which
will match any message.
The value &quot;Yes&quot; means that the particular status must be true
for a match, and the value &quot;No&quot; means that the particular
status must not be true for a match.
For example, one of the five Message Status settings is whether a message
is marked Important or not.
A &quot;Yes&quot; means that the message must be Important to be
considered a match and &quot;No&quot; means that the message must not be
Important to be considered a match.
The same is true of the other four message status settings which depend
on whether or not the message is New; whether the message has 
been Answered or not; whether the message has been Deleted or not, and
whether the message is Recent or not. 
The nomenclature is a bit confusing.
New means that the message is Unseen.
It could have been in your mailbox for a long time but if you haven't looked
at it, it is still considered New.
That matches the default <EM>Pine</EM> index display which shows an N for such a
message.
Recent means that the message was added to this folder since the last time
you opened the folder.

<H4>Raw 8-bit in Subject</H4>

It seems that lots of unwanted email contains unencoded 8-bit characters
in the Subject.
Normally, characters with the 8th bit set are not allowed in the Subject
header unless they are MIME-encoded.
This option gives you a way to match messages which have Subjects which
contain unencoded 8-bit characters.
Setting this option will affect performance in large folders because the
subject of each message in the folder has to be checked.

<H4>From or Reply-To address in Address Books</H3>

This option gives you a way to match messages which have a From or
a Reply-To address
which is in one of your address books.
Only the simple entries in your address books are searched.
Address book distribution lists are ignored!
Setting this option will affect performance in large folders because the
From and Reply-To of each message in the folder have to be checked.

<H3><A NAME="help-for-pattern-config"></A>Help Configuring Pattern Fields</H3>

<DL COMPACT>

<DT> <A NAME="role-nickname"><EM>nickname</EM></A>

<DD> This is a nickname to help you.
You should have a different nickname for each role you define.
The nickname will be used in the SETUP ROLE RULES screen to allow you to
pick a role to edit.
It will also be used when you send a message to let you know you are
sending with a different role than you use by default, and
it will be useful for choosing a role when composing with the Role command
or when composing with one of the Role Uses set to With Confirmation.
This field is not used in the outgoing message.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="to-pattern"><EM>To pattern</EM></A>

<DD> If this pattern is non-blank, then for this role to be considered a
match, at least one of the recipients from
the To line of the message being replied to or forwarded
must match this pattern.
In the case of the Compose command, this pattern and the other header
patterns are ignored.
If this pattern is a comma-separated list of patterns, then at least one of the
recipients must match at least one of the patterns.
(Any other non-blank parts of the Pattern must match, too.)
It is possible to add a <EM>NOT</EM> to the To Pattern meaning with the
&quot;!&quot; &quot;toggle NOT&quot; command.
This changes the meaning of the To pattern so that it has the opposite meaning.
It will be considered a match if there are no matches between the
addresses in the To: line and the list of To patterns.
If the message being replied to or forwarded has a Resent-To header line,
then that is used in place of the To line.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="from-pattern"><EM>From pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is just like the
<A HREF="#to-pattern"><EM>To pattern</EM></A>
except that it is compared with
the address from the From header of the message being replied to or forwarded instead
of the addresses from the To header.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="sender-pattern"><EM>Sender pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is just like the
<A HREF="#to-pattern"><EM>To pattern</EM></A>
except that it is compared with
the address from the Sender header of the message being replied to or forwarded instead
of the addresses from the To header.
If there is no Sender header, then the From header is used instead.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="cc-pattern"><EM>Cc pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is just like the
<A HREF="#to-pattern"><EM>To pattern</EM></A>
except that it is compared with
the address from the CC header of the message being replied to or forwarded instead
of the addresses from the To header.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="news-pattern"><EM>News pattern</EM></A>

<DD> If this pattern is non-blank, then for this role to be considered a
match, at least one of the newsgroups from
the Newsgroups line of the message must match this pattern.
If this pattern is a comma-separated list of patterns, then at least one of the
newsgroups must match at least one of the patterns.
(Any other non-blank parts of the Pattern must match, too.)
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="subject-pattern"><EM>Subject pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is similar to the other header patterns.
It is compared with
the contents from the Subject of the message being replied to or forwarded.
<P>
If you enter non-ascii characters in this field then the search will be
done using the character set you have defined with the
&quot;character-set&quot; configuration variable.
(The truly sophisticated may use an alternate character set for a search
by entering the MIME encoding of the header string here.)
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="extra-header-patterns"><EM>Extra header patterns</EM></A>

<DD> There isn't actually a field called Extra header patterns, but you
may add extra header patterns by moving the cursor to one of the header
patterns and using the &quot;eXtraHdr&quot; command to add a new header
pattern.
You would do this if the six predefined header patterns don't cover the
header you want to use for pattern matching.
Once you've added an extra header pattern, you use it just like the
Subject pattern.
Of course, it is compared with
the contents from the particular header field of the message being replied
to or forwarded rather than the contents from the subject field.
To remove an extra header pattern from a role, use the &quotRemoveHdr&quot;
command on the highlighted extra header.
<P>
If you enter non-ascii characters in this field then the search will be
done using the character set you have defined with the
&quot;character-set&quot; configuration variable.
(The truly sophisticated may use an alternate character set for a search
by entering the MIME encoding of the header string here.)
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="recip-pattern"><EM>Recipient pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is just like the
<A HREF="#to-pattern"><EM>To pattern</EM></A>
except that it is compared with
the addresses from both the To header and the Cc header
instead of just the addresses from the To header.
It's equivalent to having two different rules;
one with a To pattern and the other with the same Cc pattern.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="partic-pattern"><EM>Participant pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is just like the
<A HREF="#to-pattern"><EM>To pattern</EM></A>
except that it is compared with
the addresses from the To header, the Cc header, and the From header
instead of just the addresses from the To header.
It's equivalent to having three different rules;
one with a To pattern, another with the same Cc pattern, and another
with the same From pattern.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="alltext-pattern"><EM>AllText pattern</EM></A>

<DD> This is similar to the header patterns.
Instead of comparing with text in a particular header field it is compared with
all of the text in the message header and body.
<P>
If you enter non-ascii characters in this field then the search will be
done using the character set you have defined with the
&quot;character-set&quot; configuration variable.
(The truly sophisticated may use an alternate character set for a search
by entering the MIME encoding of the header string here.)
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="bodytext-pattern"><EM>BodyText pattern</EM></A>

<DD> Just like AllText, except it is compared only with the body of the
message, not the body and header.

<P>
If you enter non-ascii characters in this field then the search will be
done using the character set you have defined with the
&quot;character-set&quot; configuration variable.
(The truly sophisticated may use an alternate character set for a search
by entering the MIME encoding of the header string here.)
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="age-interval"><EM>Age Interval</EM></A>

<DD>The Age Interval, if defined, is part of the Pattern.
If you use this, it should be set to something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_age,max_age)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_age&quot; and &quot;max_age&quot; are non-negative integers.
The special value &quot;INF&quot; may be used for the max value.
It represents infinity.
<P>
When there is an Age Interval defined, it is a match if the age, in days, of
the message is contained in the interval.
The interval includes both endpoints.
<P>
Even though this option is called Age, it isn't actually
the <EM>age</EM> of the message.
Instead, it is how many days ago the message arrived in one of your folders.
If the current time is a little past midnight, then a message that arrived
just before midnight arrived yesterday, even though the message is only
a few minutes old.
By default, the date being used is not the date in the Date
header of the message.
It is the date that the message arrived in one of your folders.
When you Save a message from one folder to another that arrival date
is preserved.
If you would like to use the date in the Date header that is possible.
Turn on the option
<EM>use-date-header-for-age</EM>
near the bottom of the rule definition.
<P>
A value of 0 is today, 1 is yesterday, 2 is the day before yesterday, and so on.
The age interval
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(2,2)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
matches all messages that arrived on the day before yesterday.
The interval
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(180,INF)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
matches all messages that arrived at least 180 days before today.
The interval
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(0,1)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
matches all messages that arrived today or yesterday.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="score-interval"><EM>Score Interval</EM></A>

<DD> The Score Interval, if defined, is part of the Pattern.
If you use this, it should be set to something like:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>(min_score,max_score)</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
where &quot;min_score&quot; and &quot;max_score&quot; are integers between
-32000 and 32000.
The special values &quot;-INF&quot; and &quot;INF&quot; can be used for
the min and max values.
These represent negative and positive infinity.
<P>
When there is a Score Interval defined, it is a match if the score for
the message is contained in the interval.
The interval includes both endpoints.
The score for a message is calculated by looking at every scoring rule
defined and adding up the Score Values for the rules which match the message.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="current-folder-type"><EM>Current Folder Type</EM></A>

<DD> The Current Folder Type is part of the Pattern.
It refers to the type of the currently open folder, which is the folder
you were last looking at from the MESSAGE INDEX or MESSAGE TEXT screen.
In order for a pattern to be considered a match, the current folder must
be of the type you set here.
The three types &quot;Any&quot;, &quot;News&quot;, and &quot;Email&quot; are
all what you might think.
<P>
If the Current Folder Type for a Pattern is set to &quot;News&quot;, for
example, then
that will only be a match if the current folder is a newsgroup and
the rest of the Pattern matches.
The value &quot;Specific&quot; may be used when you want to limit the match
to a specific folder (not just a specific type of folder), or to a list of
specific folders.
In order to match a specific folder you must Select the &quot;Specific&quot;
button <EM>AND</EM> you must fill in
the name (or comma-separated list of names) of
the folder in the &quot;Folder&quot; field.
If the current folder is any of the folders in the list, that is considered
a match.
The name of each folder in the list may be either &quot;INBOX&quot;, the technical specification
of the folder (like what appears in your configuration file) or, if the
folder is one of your incoming folders, it may be the nickname you've given
the folder.
Here are a couple samples of specific folder names:
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{monet.art.nowhere.edu}mail/art-class</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><SAMP>{news.myisp.com/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine</SAMP></CENTER>
<P>
The easiest way to fill in the &quot;Folder&quot; field is to use
the T command which is available when the &quot;Folder&quot; line is
hilighted.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Folder&quot; line unless the
Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Specific&quot;, and any value that
&quot;Folder&quot; has is ignored unless the type
is set to &quot;Specific&quot;.
<P>
When reading a newsgroup, there may be a performance penalty
incurred when collecting the information necessary to check a Pattern.
For this reason, the default Current Folder Type is set to &quot;Email&quot;.
For example, a role with a non-Normal Index Line Color
and a Current Folder Type of
&quot;Any&quot; or &quot;News&quot; may cause the MESSAGE INDEX
screen to draw more slowly when in a newsgroup.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="message-status-important"><EM>Message Status Important</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means the message must be
flagged &quot;Important&quot; in order to be a match; or &quot;No&quot;, which
means the message must <EM>not</EM> be flagged &quot;Important&quot; in order
to be considered a match.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="message-status-new"><EM>Message Status New</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means the message must be
&quot;New&quot; in order to be a match; or &quot;No&quot;, which
means the message must <EM>not</EM> be &quot;New&quot; in order
to be a match.
&quot;New&quot; is the same as <EM>Unseen</EM> and not &quot;New&quot; is the
same as <EM>Seen</EM>.
<P>
The nomenclature is a bit confusing.
New means that the message is Unseen.
It could have been in your mailbox for a long time but if you haven't looked
at it, it is still considered New.
That matches the default <EM>Pine</EM> index display which shows an N for such a
message.
Recent means that the message was added to this folder since the last time
you opened the folder.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="message-status-recent"><EM>Message Status Recent</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means the message must be
&quot;Recent&quot; in order to be a match; or &quot;No&quot;, which
means the message must <EM>not</EM> be &quot;Recent&quot; in order
to be a match.
&quot;Recent&quot; means that the message was added to the folder since
the last time the folder was opened.
If more than one mail client has the folder opened, the message will
appear to be &quot;Recent&quot; to only one of the clients.
<P>
The nomenclature is a bit confusing.
New means that the message is Unseen.
It could have been in your mailbox for a long time but if you haven't looked
at it, it is still considered New.
That matches the default <EM>Pine</EM> index display which shows an N for such a
message.
Recent means that the message was added to this folder since the last time
you opened the folder.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="message-status-deleted"><EM>Message Status Deleted</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means the message must be
marked &quot;Deleted&quot; in order to be a match; or &quot;No&quot;, which
means the message must <EM>not</EM> be marked &quot;Deleted&quot; in order
to be a match.
<P>
If you are thinking of using this part of the Pattern as a way to prevent
messages from being filtered more than once in a Filter Pattern,
take a look at the Filter Option
<A HREF="#move-only-if-not-deleted">&quot;move-only-if-not-deleted&quot;</A>
instead.
It should work better than using this field since it will hide the filtered
messages even if they are already Deleted.
<P>

<DT> <A NAME="message-status-answered"><EM>Message Status Answered</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means the message must be
marked &quot;Answered&quot; in order to be a match; or &quot;No&quot;, which
means the message must <EM>not</EM> be marked &quot;Answered&quot; in order
to be a match.

<DT> <A NAME="subject-contains-raw-8bit"><EM>Subject Contains Raw 8-bit</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of three possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The other two values are &quot;Yes&quot;, which means the Subject of
the message must contain unencoded 8-bit characters (characters with the
most significant bit set)
in order to be a match; or &quot;No&quot;, which
means the Subject must <EM>not</EM>
contain unencoded 8-bit characters in order to be a match.

<DT> <A NAME="from-in-abook"><EM>From or Reply-To in Address Book</EM></A>

<DD> This part of the Pattern may have one of five possible values.
The default value is &quot;Don't care&quot;, which matches any message.
The value &quot;Yes, in any address book&quot; means either the From address
or the Reply-To address of the message must be in at least one of your
address books in order to be a match.
The value &quot;No, not in any address book&quot;
means neither the From nor the Reply-To addresses may
be in any of your address books in order to be a match.
<P>
The values &quot;Yes, in specific address books&quot; and
&quot;No, not in any of specific address books&quot; are similar but instead
of depending on all address books you are allowed to give a list of address
books to look in.
Usually this would be a single address book but it may be a comma-separated
list of address books as well.
For each of these &quot;specific&quot; address book options you Select which
of the Specific options you want (Yes or No) <EM>AND</EM> fill in the
name (or comma-separated list of names) of the address book in the
&quot;Abook List&quot; field.
The names to be used are those that appear in the ADDRESS BOOK LIST screen.
The easiest way to fill in the Abook List field it to use
the &quot;T&quot; command which is available when the &quot;Abook List&quot;
line is highlighted.
Note that you won't be able to edit the &quot;Abook List&quot; line unless the
option is set to one of the two &quot;Specific&quot;, values.
