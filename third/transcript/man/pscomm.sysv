.SH NAME
pscomm \(em\*(TS serial communications filter for \*(PS printers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B XPSLIBDIRX/pscomm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the low-level \*(TS serial communication filter for use by the 
System V line printer spooling system.  It is called from the
.I psinterface
shell script.
The program 
.I pscomm
is the lowest level filter.  It manages communication with the printer,
error handling, status reporting, etc.  
Psinterface 
and 
.I pscomm
manage a printer log file named
transcript/\fIprinter\fP-log (under the lp spooling directory).
This file contains a log of each job processed, as well as any
error output from the printer.  In particular, it contains messages
regarding the printer being out of paper, jammed, etc.  Doing a 
tail
on this file will help determine the printer's status.
