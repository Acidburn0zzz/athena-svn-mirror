.ds PS P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2
.SH NAME
psrev \- select or reverse the page order of a PostScript file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psrev
[ 
.B \-R
] [
.BI \-s pagespec
] [
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I psrev
is a script which reads in the specified \*(PS language
.I file
(or the standard input if no file is named) and, if the input conforms
to the \*(PS language document structuring conventions, reverses and
selects specified pages for printing, and writes the resulting file on
the standard output.
.PP
.I psrev
is no longer a part of the Transcript package from Adobe.  Transcript
now contains
.IR pslpr ,
which provides equivalent functionality in addition to several more
advanced options.  In order to facilitate the transition to Transcript
4.1, Athena release 8.0 contains a simple script that understands old
.I psrev
options and invokes
.I pslpr
with appropriate arguments.  However, this script will probably be
removed in the next Athena release, and the users are encouraged to use
.I pslpr
instead.
.sp
The possible options are:
.TP
.BI \-s " pagespec"
specifies a range (or several ranges) of pages to be printed.
.I Pagespec
is a string, not containing spaces, of the form ``pagerange[,pagespec]''.
.I Pagerange
may be a single page number or a range 
of the form ``N-M'' which means print pages N through M.
.sp
With original
.IR psrev ,
-N would print from the beginning of the document to page N, and M-
would print from page M to the end of the document.  With the current
script, -N is equivalent to 1-N, and M- is equivalent to M-9999; these
may not be equivalent to the old meanings if your document uses an
unorthodox page numbering.
.sp
The analogous
.I pslpr
option is
.BI -i pagerange
which can be specified multiple times for multiple ranges.  Thus,
.I psrev
``-sM-N,P-Q,...'' is equivalent to
.I pslpr
``-iM-N -iP-Q ...''.
.I pslpr
does not accept ranges of the form ``-N'' or ``M-''.
.TP
.B -R
will not reverse the page order (the default is to reverse).
.sp
Note that the meaning of the -R option in
.I pslpr
is exactly opposite from
.IR psrev .
.SH EXAMPLES
The following command reads a \*(PS language file called infile.ps and
outputs pages 3 through 19, 37 through 60 and page 90 to outfile.ps.
.RS .5i
psrev -R -s3-19,37-60,90 printfile.ps > outfile.ps
.RE
Here are two ways to accomplish the same effect using
.IR pslpr :
.RS .5i
pslpr -p outfile.ps -i3-19 -i37-60 -i90 infile.ps
.br
pslpr -p- -i3-19 -i37-60 -i90 infile.ps > outfile.ps
.RE
.PP
In the next example, a text file is processed by enscript, creating a
\*(PS language file which is page-reversed and printed on printer
named ``ajax'':
.RS .5i
enscript -p- textfile | psrev | lpr -Pajax
.RE
Or, using
.I pslpr
again:
.RS .5i
enscript -p- textfile | pslpr -R -Pajax
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP PSRESOURCEPATH
path name to use for accessing printer resource information
for downloadable resources
.IP PSTEMPDIR
path name of a temporary directory to use instead of /usr/tmp 
for spooled temporary files
