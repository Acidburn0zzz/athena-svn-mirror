.SH NAME
psroff\(emditroff to a P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psroff
[ 
.B -t
] [
.I "troff options"
] [
.I "spool options"
] [
.I files
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I psroff
is a shell script that runs
[di]troff(1)
in an environment to produce output on a \*(PS printer.
It uses
psdit
to convert
ditroff
intermediate output to \*(PS language format and spools this for printing.
If no 
.I files
are specified, the standard input is used.
.PP
For those interested in including arbitrary \*(PS language commands
or files in a
ditroff
document, see psdit(1).
.PP
In addition to the standard 
ditroff 
options, the following options are understood by 
.IR psroff .
.TP
.B -t 
sends the \*(PS language file to the standard output, 
rather than spooling it to a printer.
Note that this overrides the meaning of the 
ditroff
.B -t 
option; if you want that, run 
ditroff
directly.
.TP
.BI -F fontfamily
use the specified font family for the R/I/B/BI fonts, rather than the
default family, which is
Times.
Font families
Times,
Courier,
and
Helvetica
are probably defined at
your site, and others may be available as well.
Make sure the printer you will use contains the font family you pick.
Note that this overrides the meaning of the 
ditroff
.B -F 
option; if you want that, run 
ditroff
directly, or use the
.B -D
option.
.TP
.BI -D fontdirectory
finds font family directories in the specified
.I fontdirectory
rather than the standard font directory which was configured in the
installation procedure.
Note that it may be necessary to use both this option and the
.B -F
option to imitate the
.B -F
option in
ditroff.
.PP
In BSD UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
lpr.
.TP
.BI -P printer
causes the output to be sent to the named printer.
.TP
.BI -# n
causes 
.I n 
copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.
.TP
.B -h
suppresses the printing of the job burst page.
.TP
.BI -C class
set the job classification for use on the burst page.
.TP
.BI -J name
sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name of the
first input file will be used.
.TP
.BI -m
sends mail after files have been printed.
.PP
In System V UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
lp.
.TP
.BI -d dest
causes the output to be sent to the named destination.
.TP
.BI -n n
causes 
.I n 
copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.
.TP
.B -h
suppresses the printing of the job burst page.
.TP
.B -r
don't page-reverse the output.
.TP
.BI -s
suppresses messages from 
lp.
.TP
.BI -m
sends mail after files have been printed.
.TP
.BI -w
writes to user's terminal after files have been printed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP "PRINTER (BSD)"
the name of a printer (as in the 
.B -P
option) for 
lpr
to use.  If no 
.B -P 
option is specified,
lpr
will use this printer.  If neither
.B -P
nor PRINTER is set,
.I psroff
will spool to a printer named "PostScript".
.IP "LPDEST (System V)"
the name of a printer (as in the 
.B -d
option) for 
lp
to use.  If no 
.B -d 
option is specified,
lp
will use this printer.  If neither
.B -d
nor LPDEST is set,
.I psroff
will spool to a printer class named "PostScript".
.SH FILES

.SH BUGS
The 
eqn
supplied with 
ditroff
is different from the original.  Use the options 
.B -r576
.B -m2
for best results.  Other programs (e.g.,
pic )
distributed with 
ditroff
have the device names compiled in (so much for device independence!).
They should just have a 
.B -T
option and read the device description file for the information they need.
Use
.B -T576
with the
pic
distributed with 
DWB.
