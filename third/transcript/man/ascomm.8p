.SH NAME
ascomm\(em\*(TS AppSocket TCP/IP communication filter for \*(PS printers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B XPSLIBDIRX/ascomm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the low-level \*(TS AppSocket TCP/IP communication filter for use
by the 4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer description
file /etc/printcap, or by the System V spooling system.
For 4.2BSD, it is called from the
.I psint.sh
shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the name it was invoked under)
to determine which action to take, which may involve invoking a translation
filter or management filter before invoking the communications filter. 
The options are as specified in the
.I 4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual.
If a log file is specified in /etc/printcap, 
.ascomm
will maintain a log of each job processed, as well as any error output from
the printer.
For System V, it is called from the 
.I psinterface
shell script.
The program 
.I ascomm
is the lowest level filter.  It manages communication with the printer,
error handling, status reporting, etc.  It also manages a printer log file
named transcript/\fIprinter\fP-log (under the lp spooling directory). 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP VERBOSELOG=\fInumber\fP
print verbose log messages
.IP ASCONTROL=\fInumber\fP
if 1, use AppSocket control protocol (default)
.IP ASSTATUS=\fInumber\fP
if 1, query status during job on status port (default)
