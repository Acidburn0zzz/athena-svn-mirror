.SH NAME
ascomm \- TranScript AppSocket TCP/IP communication filter for PostScript
printers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B XPSLIBDIRX/ascomm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the low-level \*(TS AppSocket TCP/IP communication filter for use
by the 4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer description
file /etc/printcap.  It is called from the
.I psint.sh
shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the name it was invoked under)
to determine which action to take, which may involve invoking a translation
filter or management filter before invoking the communications filter. 
The options are as specified in the
.I 4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual.
If a log file is specified in /etc/printcap, 
.ascomm
will maintain a log of each job processed, as well as any error output from
the printer.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP VERBOSELOG=\fInumber\fP
print verbose log messages
.IP ASCONTROL=\fInumber\fP
if 1, use AppSocket control protocol (default)
.IP ASSTATUS=\fInumber\fP
if 1, query status during job on status port (default)
