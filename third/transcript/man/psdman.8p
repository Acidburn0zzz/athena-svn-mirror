.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I psdman
is the \*(TS document manager invoked by the printer interface script
psinterface
(System V) or
psint.sh
(BSD)
after the printer interface program has been invoked by the print spooler.
.PP
.I psdman
is responsible for reading the the document file to be printed, and
taking the appropriate action to prepare the file for printing on a
\*(PS printer.
.I psdman
distinguishes between text files (which get formatted) and \*(PS language 
files.  If the input to 
.I psdman
does not begin with the \*(PS language
magic number\(emthe first two characters being "%!"\(em
.I psdman
will invoke
enscript
to create a listing of the file.
If the first bytes of the input file are "%!PS-Adobe-",
and if the printer options so specify,
.I psdman
will also will perform various document management tasks,
such as page reversal, font and other resource downloading, and
printer-specific feature inclusion (manual feed, duplex, paper tray
setting, etc.)
before printing, if so requested.
.I psdman 
supports LZW compression and ASCII85 encodingfor Level 2 printers.
.sp
The possible options are:
.TP
.BI -r
never reverse.
.TP
.BI -f
continues processing despite errors.  This is the default.
.TP
.BI -s
stops when errors are encountered.
.TP
.BI -G
do not attempt to rearrange fonts for more efficient downloading.
.TP
.BI -F
turns off parsing.  If this is specified,
.I psdman
will simply pass the data
through without attempting to perform any document management.  Conversion
of text files will still occur.
.TP
.BI -a
strips out comments.  If this is specified, psdman will strip out any line
that begins with "%".
.TP
.BI -L
landscape.  
.I Psdman
will cause the input to be printed rotated 90 degrees.
It will not attempt to make sure the resulting image will fit on the page.
.TP
.BI -P printername
.I printername
is the name of the \*(PS printer for which output is intended.
.TP
.BI -p program
.I program
(BSD only) is the name of the program through which psdman was invoked.
Typically this is 
psif.
.TP
.BI -h host
.I host
(BSD only) is the name of the host from which the print job originated.
.TP
.BI -n user
.I user
(BSD only) is the name of the user for whom the print job is being printed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT 
.br
There are a number of environment variables used by
.I psdman
which are listed below.
The
psinterface
(System V) or
psint.sh
(BSD)
script sets the initial value for each,
and the printer options file can be used to change the value for a
particular printer.
Note that Bourne shell syntax must be used in the printer options file.
For BSD, this file is in the spool directory; for System V, look in
/usr/spool/lp/transcript/ps.opt.
Many of the variables take a numerical value, and specify whether
an action should take place or not; 1 means do the action and
0 means don't do it.
.TP 
.BI REVERSE "=\fInumber\fP "
reverse the page order
.TP
.BI VERBOSELOG "=\fInumber\fP "	
print verbose log messages
.TP
.BI COMPRESS "=\fInumber\fP "
perform LZW compression on the file
.TP
.BI PSTEMPDIR "=\fIDirectory name\fP "
directory for temporary files
.PP
You could turn off page reversal for a particular printer
by adding this line to the printer options file:
.br
\ \ \ \ REVERSE=0
\ \ \ \ export REVERSE
.SH FILES
