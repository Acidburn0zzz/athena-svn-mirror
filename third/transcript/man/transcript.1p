.SH NAME
TranScript \- Programs for accessing PostScript printers
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(TS package is a suite of UNIX programs that enables
UNIX systems to access state-of-the-art \*(PS printers.
The package transforms UNIX documents and graphics files
into \*(PS language format.
The \*(PS language is a device-independent programming language and print
file format for describing the appearance of printed pages. \*(PS language 
documents can combine text, graphics, line art, and scanned images
for printing on raster devices.  \*(PS language files will print
.I without modification
on any \*(PS printer.
.sp
The \*(TS package includes
translator filters for
common UNIX document file formats like
troff,
ditroff,
and
plot.
It also includes filters for "line-printer" listings,
Diablo 630 print files, and Tektronix 4014 files.
\*(TS software is fully integrated into the
spooling architecture, and includes the communications filters
necessary to print job banner pages, do page accounting,
and perform communication with a \*(PS printer.
.sp
The following programs are provided with the \*(TS release.  See the
appropriate 
manual page for each filter for more details.
.TP .75i
.I enscript
converts plain text files into \*(PS language format. Fonts, headings, and
limited formatting options may be specified, as well as spooling options.
.TP
.I ps4014
converts Tektronix 4014 graphics terminal commands into \*(PS language format.
.TP
.I ps630
converts Diablo 630 word processing files into \*(PS language format.
.TP
.I psplot
converts UNIX plot(1) format files into \*(PS language format.
.TP
.I pslpr
Reverse page order and/or select specified pages in \*(PS language format
files .
Pslpr also provides other document management services such as font
downloading, downloading of other resources such as procedure sets, and
handling 
of printer-specific features.  It is similar in function to psdman, but is
invoked by the user, so the user has more control over things such as 
where fonts and resources are obtained.  These services are provided for
documents that conform to the Document Structuring Conventions.  See the
pslpr(1)
manual page for a more complete description of this filter and its
various functions.
.TP
.I psnup
prints multiple virtual pages on a single page, for documents
that conform to the Document Structuring Conventions.
See the
psnup(1)
manual page for a more complete description of this filter and its
various functions.
.TP
.I psroff
converts
[di]troff(1)
input into \*(PS language format.
This is actually a shell script.
See the
psroff(1)
manual page for more information.
.TP
.I ptroff
converts
[o]troff(1)
input into \*(PS language format.
This is actually a shell script.
See the
ptroff(1)
manual page for more information.
.TP
.I psfax
prepares documents for sending as FAX transmissions from \*(PS printers
with fax capabilities.
See the psfax(1) manual page for more information.
.TP
.I psdraft
adds a draft string to a document.  
See the psdraft(1) manual page for more information.
.TP
.I ppanel
a Motif graphical user interface to the \*(TS programs.
See the ppanel(1) manual page for more information.
.TP
.I pscomm
the program that performs serial communication with the \*(PS printer.
This is normally invisible to the casual user.
See the
pscomm(8)
manual page for a more complete description.
.I qmscomm
the program that performs network communication with a QMS \*(PS printer.
This is normally invisible to the casual user.
See the
qmscomm(8)
manual page for a more complete description.
.I fpcomm
the program that performs network communication with a \*(PS printer
connected via a MiLAN FastPort box.
This is normally invisible to the casual user.
See the
fpcomm(8)
manual page for a more complete description.
.I lpcomm
the program that performs parallel communication with the \*(PS printer.
This is normally invisible to the casual user.
See the
lpcomm(8)
manual page for a more complete description.
.I capcomm
the program that performs Appletalk communication with the \*(PS printer.
This is normally invisible to the casual user.
See the
capcomm(8)
manual page for a more complete description.
.TP
.I psdman
the \*(TS document manager.  Invoked by 
psint.sh to process print files.  Calls 
enscript
to convert text files to \*(PS language format, if necessary.
psdman 
is normally invisible to the user and is not intended 
to be invoked in a command line.  Psdman performs document management
functions such as page reversal (if desired), font downloading, other
resource downloading, and handling of printer-specific features for
documents that conform to the Document Structuring Conventions.
See the
psdman(8)
manual page for a more complete description.
