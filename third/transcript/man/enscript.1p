.SH DESCRIPTION
.I enscript
reads in plain text files, converts them to \*(PS language, and spools them
for  
printing on a \*(PS printer.  Fonts, headings, limited formatting 
options, and spooling options may be specified.
.sp
For example:
.RS
enscript -Paleph boring.txt
.RE
prints a copy of the file called boring.txt on the printer called
aleph.
.RS
enscript -2r boring.c
.RE
prints a two-up landscape listing of the file called boring.c on 
the default printer (see below).
.sp
Font specifications have two parts:
a font name as known to the \*(PS printer (e.g., Times-Roman, Times-BoldItalic,
Helvetica, Courier), and a point size (1 point=1/72 inch; 8 point 
is a good small point size).  So Courier-Bold8 is 8 point Courier Bold, 
Helvetica12 is 12 point Helvetica.
.sp
The environment variable ENSCRIPT may be used to specify defaults.  The 
value of ENSCRIPT is parsed as a string of arguments 
.I before 
the arguments 
that appear on the command line.  For example "ENSCRIPT=\'-fTimes-Roman8\'" 
sets the default body font to 8 point Times Roman.
.sp
The possible options are:
.TP
.B -1
sets in 
1 
column. One column is the default.
.TP
.B -2
sets in 
2 
columns.
.TP
.BI -v columns
output is set in 
.I columns
number of columns.  This is an extension of the 
.B -2 
switch. 
.TP
.B -r
rotates the output 90 degrees (landscape mode).
This is good for output that requires a wide page or for program listings
when used in conjunction with
.B -2.
.br
"
.B
enscript -2r files
" is a nice way to get program listings.
.TP
.B -R
don't rotate, also known as portrait mode (the default).
.TP
.B -G
prints in gaudy mode: causes page headings, dates, and page numbers to be
printed 
in a flashy style, at some slight performance expense.
.TP
.B -l
simulates a line printer: make pages 66 lines long and omit headers.
.TP
.B -B
omits page headings.
.TP
.B -c
truncates ("cuts") lines that are longer than the page width.
Normally, long lines are wrapped around to the following line on the page.
.TP
.BI -b header
sets the string to be used for page headings to
.IR header .  
The default header is constructed from the file name, its last
modification date, and a page number.  You can include elements from the
default header in your header by specifying %f for file name, %d for date,
or %n for page number.  If you need a \'%\' character in the header, it must
be specified by "%%".
.TP
.BI -L lines
set the maximum number of lines to output on a page.
.I Enscript
usually computes how many lines to put on a page based on point size,
and may put fewer lines per page than requested by 
.IR lines .
.TP
.BI -f bfont
sets the font to be used for the body of each page.
The default is Courier10 unless two-column rotated mode is used, in which
case the default is Courier7.
.TP
.BI -F hfont
sets the font to be used for page headings.
The default is Courier-Bold10.
.TP
.BI -p out
causes the \*(PS file to be written to the named file rather than
being spooled for printing.  As a special case, 
.B -p
.I-
will send the resulting\*(PS language code to the standard output.
.TP
.B -g
causes the fact that a file is garbage to be ignored.  Normally, any file
with more than a small number of nonprinting characters is suspected of
being garbage and not printed; this option means "print it anyway."
.TP
.B -o
if
.I enscript
cannot find characters in a font, the missing characters are listed.
.TP
.B -q
causes 
.I enscript
to be quiet about what it is doing. 
.I Enscript 
won't report about pages, destination, omitted characters, etc.  
Fatal errors are still reported to the standard error output.
.TP
.B -h
suppresses printing of the job burst page.
.TP
.BI -s size
chooses a paper size for printing.  This size must match one of the
*PaperSize keywords in the \*(PS Printer Description file, such as
Letter, Legal, or A4.
.TP
.BI -S feature=value
chooses a printer feature, such as manual feed or duplex.  If 
.I value
is omitted, a value of true is assumed.  These features must match a
keyword in the \*(PS Printer Description file.  For example, 
"enscript -S ManualFeed" turns on manual feed. 
.TP
.BI -T characters
sets the width of a tab to be 
.I characters
 number of characters.  This is
especially useful to get columns to line up correctly when printing with a variable width font.
.PP
In BSD Unix systems, the following spooler options are also recognized:
.TP
.BI -P printer
causes the output to be sent to the named printer
unless 
.BI -p file
is specified. In that case, the printer name is used to access the 
printer's \*(PS Printer Description file for information, and the
output is written to 
the specified file instead of being spooled for printing.
.TP
.BI -# n
causes 
.I n 
copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.
.TP
.B -m
causes the printer daemon to send mail upon job completion.
.TP
.BI -J name
sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name of the
first input file will be used.
.TP
.BI -C class
set the job classification for use on the burst page.
.PP
In System V Unix systems, the following spooler options are also recognized:
.TP
.BI -t title
sets job title for use on the burst page.
.TP
.BI -d dest
causes the output to be sent to the named printer or printer 
class unless 
.BI -p file
is specified. In that case, the printer name is used to access the 
printer's \*(PS Printer Description file for information, and the
output is written to 
the specified file instead of being spooled for printing.
.TP
.BI -n n
causes 
.I n
copies of the output to be produced. The default is one.
.TP
.BR -w " or " -m
causes the printer daemon to write or send mail upon job completion.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP ENSCRIPT
string of options to be used by
.I enscript
.IP PSLIBDIR
path name of a directory to use instead of XPSLIBDIRX 
for 
.I enscript
prologue and font metric files
.IP PSTEMPDIR
path name of a temporary directory to use instead of XPSTEMPDIRX 
for temporary files.
.IP "PRINTER (BSD)"
the name of a printer (as in the 
.B -P
option) for 
lpr
to use.  If no 
.B -P 
option is specified, 
lpr
will use this printer.  If neither 
.B -P 
nor PRINTER is set,
.I enscript
will spool to a printer named "PostScript".
.IP "LPDEST (System V)"
the name of a printer (as in the 
.B -d
option) for 
lp
to use.  If no 
.B -d
option is specified,
lp
will use this printer.  If neither 
.B -d 
nor LPDEST is set,
.I enscript
will spool to a printer class named "PostScript".

Gaudy mode by Guy Riddle of AT&T Bell Laboratories
.SH BUGS
.I Enscript
generates temporary files which are spooled for printing.  The temporary file
names are used by the spooling software (e.g., 
lpq ),
rather than the symbolic job name passed to 
lpr .
.sp
There are too many options.
