.SH DESCRIPTION
.I pslpr
reads in the specified \*(PS language
.I file
(or the standard input if no file is named) and, if the
input conforms to the \*(PS language document structuring conventions,
provides page order reversal, landscape orientation, 
and selection of specified pages for printing.
Font and other resource downloading is supported as well as 
inclusion of printer-specific features such as manual feed.
.I pslpr
also supports ASCII85 encoding and LZW compression for Level 2 printers.
.I pslpr
sends output to 
.I
filename
if the 
.B -p
option is used; otherwise the output is printed on the printer 
specified by either the
.br
.BI -P printer 
option for BSD or the 
.BI -d dest
option of System V. If none of these options is used, 
.I
pslpr
prints on the printer specified by the PRINTER environment variable,
if present, or to a printer named "PostScript".
.sp
The possible options are:
.TP
.BI -i pagerange
.I pagerange
may be a single page number or a range 
of the form "N-M" which means print pages N through M.
Multiple instances of
.I pagerange
may be specified by repetitive use of this option.
.TP
.B -R
reverses the page order.
.TP
.B -L
prints the document in landscape format.
Use of this option when processing a \*(PS language document that describes
a page which 
is longer than the width of the paper being used will result in truncation
at the top of the printed page.  You can use the 
.B -u
switch to force the truncation of the bottom of the page instead of the
top, or the 
.B -q
option to shrink the image to fit in the width of the paper.
When using the n-up capabilitiy of psnup, it is preferable 
to also use the rotate option of psnup rather than
the landscape option of 
.I pslpr
because the rotation of the page
is taken into account by psnup when laying out multiple pages 
on a sheet of paper.
.TP
.BI -l resourcepath
specifies the path name for a printer resource.  If the resource is not
available in the printer, as defined in the printer's \*(PS Printer
Description file, 
.I pslpr
will download the resource to the printer.
.TP
.BI -p filename
sends the document to the specified file, instead of printing it. If
.B -p-
is specified, output is directed to standard output.
.TP
.BI -f
forces 
.I pslpr
to proceed despite errors.
.TP
.BI -F 
don't perform any manipulation of the document\(emno page reversal, font
downloading, etc.
.TP
.BI -G 
don't rearrange.
.I pslpr
will attempt to rearrange downloaded fonts 
to minimize transmission
time if the printer has enough memory. the  -G option 
disables this feature.
.TP
.BI -a 
strips comments.
Strips out all lines that begin with "%".  This should not be used if later
processing of this document is expected.
.TP
.B -z 
performs LZW compression and ASCII85 encoding of the document.  This
feature is available only in Level 2 printers.
.TP
.B -e
adds showpage.  This is useful when printing Encapsulated \*(PS files,
which may or may 
not have a showpage in them.
.TP
.B -q
shrinks to fit.  This is used in conjunction with landscape mode.  When
specified, the image will be scaled to fit on the rotated page.
.TP
.B -u
overtranslates when rotating.  The default behavior when landscape is
specified is to translate the axis so that the bottom left corner of the
rotated page corresponds with the origin.  If this switch is specified, the
axis will be translated beyond that, so that the point in the coordinate
space that matched the upper left corner of the unrotated page will match
the upper left corner of the rotated page.  This is useful when rotating
images produced by programs whose idea of the origin of the coordinate
space is at the top of the page, rather than the bottom, as in the \*(PS
language imaging model.
.TP
.BI -S feature = value 
Sets a printer-specific feature, such as manual feed.  If no value is
specified, a value of "TRUE" is assumed.  Any feature named in the
target printer's \*(PS Printer Description file can be used here.
.PP
In BSD UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
lpr.
.TP
.BI -P printer
causes the output to be sent to the named printer, unless 
.I
filename
is specified; in which case, the printer name is used to access the 
printer's \*(PS Printer Description file for information, and the output is
written to 
the specified file instead of being spooled for printing.
.TP
.BI -# n
causes 
.I n 
copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.
.TP
.B -h
suppresses the printing of the job burst page.
.TP
.BI -C class"
sets the job classification for use on the burst page.
.TP
.BI -J name"
sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name of the
first input file will be used.
.TP
.BI -m
sends mail after files have been printed.
.TP
.BI -r
renames the file after printing.
.PP
In System V UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
lp.
See the man pages for LP(C) and LPR(W) for more complete descriptions.
.TP
.BI -d dest
causes the output to be sent to the named printer unless 
.BI -p file
is specified; in which case, the printer name is used to access the 
printer's \*(PS Printer Description file for information, and the output is
written to 
the specified file instead of being spooled for printing.
.TP
.BI -c
immediately makes a copy of the file to be printed.
.TP
.BI -n n
causes 
.I n 
copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.
.TP
.B -h
suppresses the printing of the job burst page.
.TP
.B -r
don't page-reverse the output.
.TP
.BI -s
suppresses messages from 
lp.
.TP
.BI -m
sends mail after files have been printed.
.TP
.BI -t title
specifies the title.
.TP
.BI -w
writes to the user's terminal after files have been printed.
.TP
.BI -o option
sends a printer-dependent or class dependent option to print spooler.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command reads a \*(PS language file called printfile.ps
and prints pages 3 through 19, 37
through 60 and page 90, in landscape format.  The 
.B -d
option (System V only; for BSD use the
.B -P
option) directs
the output to the printer called ps, and is required when using the
-L option.

.RS
pslpr -i3-19 -i37-60 -i90 -L -dps  printfile.ps

.RE
In the next example, a textfile is processed by enscript, creating a \*(PS
language file which is piped to
.I pslpr
and printed page-reversed on the printer
named LaserBlaster. The first line
in the example is for BSD, the second for System V.

.RS
enscript -p- textfile | pslpr -R -PLaserBlaster

enscript -p- textfile | pslpr -R -dLaserBlaster

.RE
In this example, a \*(PS language file (doc.ps) is prepared for printing on
a specific  
printer (LaserBlaster), but is saved in a file (LBprintfile), 
instead of being spooled for printing.  Again, the first line
in the example is for BSD, the second for System V.

.RS
pslpr -pLBprintfile -PLaserBlaster doc.ps

pslpr -pLBprintfile -dLaserBlaster doc.ps

.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP PSRESOURCEPATH
path name to use for accessing printer resource information
for downloadable resources
.IP PSTEMPDIR
path name of a temporary directory to use instead of XPSTEMPDIRX 
for spooled temporary files
.IP "PRINTER (BSD)"
the name of a printer (as in the 
.B -P
option) for 
lpr
to use.  If no 
.B -P 
option is specified, 
lpr
will use this printer.  If neither 
.B -P 
nor PRINTER is set,
.I pslpr
will spool to a printer named "PostScript".
.IP "LPDEST (System V)"
the name of a printer (as in the 
.B -d
option) for 
lp
to use.  If no 
.B -d
option is specified,
lp
will use this printer.  If neither 
.B -d 
nor LPDEST is set,
.I pslpr
will spool to a printer class named "PostScript".
