.SH DESCRIPTION
.I psnup
reads in a \*(PS language 
.I file
(or the standard input if no file is named) and, if the
input conforms to the \*(PS language document structuring conventions,
provides page rotation, printing of multiple pages on a sheet 
of paper (n-up printing), selection of page and paper sizes,
and writes the resulting file on the standard output.  The output
may be directed to a file.
.sp
The possible options are:
.TP
.BI -n nupspec
.I nupspec
may be a single number specifying how many pages will be
printed on each sheet of paper, or a specification  of the form: 
.I n
x
.I m,
where 
.I n
and
.I m
specify rows and columns, respectively. Rows refers to 
the number of page images across a sheet of paper, columns to the
number of page images down a sheet of paper.  The specification
.BI -n 2x2 
is  equivalent to the specification
.BI -n 4. 
If the number of pages on a sheet is specified as a single
number, the number must be a power of 2.
.TP
.B -r
rotates the page 90 degrees (landscape mode).
When using the n-up capability of
.I psnup,
this option
is preferable to the landscape option of pslpr because the rotation of the page
is taken into account when laying out multiple pages on a sheet of paper.
.TP
.BI -S papersize
specifies size of paper for which output is to be formatted.  The 
default is Letter (8.5 x 11).
.TP
.BI -s pagesize
specifies the size of pages being printed n-up (i.e., the original size).  The
default is Letter (8.5 x 11).
.TP
.BI -w pagewidth
if the size of the pages being printed n-up isn't a standard size, you can
specify the width and height instead.  Numbers followed by "i" will be
interpreted in inches, by "m" in millimeters, and numbers without
qualification will be interpreted as specifying the distance in points.
.TP
.BI -h pageheight
specifies the height of the page being printed n-up.
.TP
.B -G
formats the document in psnup's "gaudy" mode, with borders around the virtual
pages.  If no n-up specification is given, the input file is printed with
four virtual pages per sheet of paper.
.TP
.BI -p outputfile
writes output to the specified file.
.BI-p -
means write output to standard output.
.TP
.BI -P printername
.TP
.BI -d printername
uses
.IR printername's
\*(PS Printer Description file for information about available paper sizes.
The 
result is 
.IR not
spooled to the printer.

.SH EXAMPLES
The following command reads a \*(PS language file called printfile.ps
and formats it with four pages on a sheet of paper.  The file is 
piped through pslpr to be printed on the printer called ps.

.RS
psnup -n4 printfile.ps | pslpr -Pps

.RE
In this example, a text file is processed by enscript, creating a \*(PS
language file, which is piped to 
.I
psnup,
which rotates the file and formats it with three virtual pages across 
and two virtual pages down the paper.
The formatted file is printed by piping the file through pslpr.

.RS
enscript -p- textfile | psnup -r -n3x2 | pslpr

.RE
In this example, a text file is processed by enscript, creating a \*(PS
language file, which is piped to
.I psnup,
formatted in gaudy mode (
.B -G
option),
with four virtual pages per actual page of output.
The formatted file is printed by piping the file through pslpr.  The
result is printed pages with four original text pages on each sheet, with each
original text page surrounded by a border.
