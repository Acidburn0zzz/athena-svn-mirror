.SH NAME
capcomm\(em\*(TS Appletalk communication filter for \*(PS printers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B XPSLIBDIRX/pscomm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the low-level \*(TS Appletalk communication filter for use by the 
4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer description file 
/etc/printcap.  It uses the CAP libraries to communicate with printers
connected to Appletalk networks.
It is called from the
.I psint.sh
shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the name it was invoked under)
to determine which action to take, which may involve invoking a translation
filter or management filter before invoking the communications filter. 
The options are as specified in the
.I 4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual.  
The program 
.I pscomm
is the lowest level filter.  It manages communication with the printer,
error handling, status reporting, etc.
