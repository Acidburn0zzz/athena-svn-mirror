.SH NAME
psdit \- convert ditroff intermediate format to PostScript language format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B psdit
[
.BI -F fontdir
] [
.BI -p prologue
] [
.BI -o list
] [
.I file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I psdit
translates a
.I file
created by device-independent
[di]troff (1)
to \*(PS language format for printing on a \*(PS printer.
If no
.I file
is mentioned, the standard input is used.
The \*(PS language file is sent to the standard output.
The options are:
.TP
.BI -F fontdir
take font information from
.I fontdir
instead of the default (see below).
.TP
.BI -p prologue
use the contents of
.I prologue
instead of the default \*(PS language prologue (see below).
.TP
.BI -o list
prints pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated
.IR list .
The list contains single numbers
.I N
and ranges
.IB N1 \- N2.
A missing 
.I N1
means the lowest-numbered page, a missing
.I N2
means the highest.
.PP
.B Note:
the input for 
.I psdit
should be prepared with the corresponding
.B -Tpsc
option of
[ di ] troff , 
pic ,
etc.
.br
eqn
should be run with the flags
.B -r576
and
.BR -m2
to produce suitable output.  
.br
pic
should be run with the 
.B -D
flag.
With 
.B DWB
pic ,
use
.B -T576
to set the correct resolution.
.PP
.I psdit
allows for users to cause 
.I troff
to include arbitrary \*(PS language code in the generated document.
.I psdit 
recognizes the undefined "%" command in the
ditroff intermediate file format to signal the start of raw \*(PS language
to be placed 
.I 
as is
in the the output file.  Everthing between (but not including)
the percent sign and a line containing a single period (".") will
be placed in the generated output.  This code is not insulated
from the 
ditroff
coordinate system or the state of the generated code. However, two functions
are defined in the prologue so that users may insulate themselves if they
so desire.  The 
.B PB
function (for \fIpicture begin\fP) will execute the \*(PS language operator
.B save ,
translate the coordinate system to 
ditroff's
idea of the current position on the page, and change the scale and
orientation of the coordinate system axes to be the standard 72 units
per inch.  The
.B PE
macro (for \fIpicture end\fP) will end this protected environment.
.LP
Several methods may be employed to incorporate such included \*(PS language
code 
into the ditroff intermediate file.  The ".sy", "\\\&!" and ".cf"
troff
commands may be useful.
For example, the following sequence could be used to include the \*(PS
language description of a completely separate, printable document.
Note that the "showpage" operator is redefined.
.RS
.br
(usual troff input)
.br
\\\&&
.br
\&.fl
.br
\\\&!%PB
.br
\\\&!/showpage{}def
.br
\&.fl
.br
\&.sy cat mypic.ps
.br
\\\&!PE
.br
\\\&!.
.br
(more regular troff input)
.RE
This example includes
.I mypic.ps
as an illustration.  This facility is both powerful and useful.
Indiscriminate inclusion of badly behaving \*(PS language code may be
dangerous to your document's health.
.PP
.I psdit
also supports the \\X feature of DWB 2.0 and 
has support for the psfig package.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP

path name of a directory to use instead of
XPSLIBDIRX for the
.I psdit
prologue
.SH FILES

.SH BUGS
The versions of 
eqn
and 
pic
distributed with ditroff (from AT&T) have the device names compiled in
(so much for device independence!).  They should just read the device
description file for the information they need.  You should be sure
to know which version of 
eqn 
you are running or you will get undesirable results.
.br
The B-splines generated by
.I ditroff
are drawn with an approximation.  The functions 
.B D~
and 
.B D~~
in the prologue need a little work.
