.SH NAME
qmscomm \- TranScript Ethernet communication filter
for QMS PostScript printers
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B XPSLIBDIRX/qmscomm
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This is the low-level \*(TS Ethernet communication filter for use by the 
4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer description file 
/etc/printcap 
in communicating with QMS Ethernet printers.
It is called from the
psint.sh
shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the name it was invoked under)
to determine which action to take, which may involve invoking a translation
filter or management filter before invoking the communications filter. 
The options are as specified in the
.I 4.2BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual.  
The program 
.I qmscomm
is the lowest level filter.  It manages the communication with the printer,
including status reporting.  Page accounting is not supported with 
.I qmscomm.
