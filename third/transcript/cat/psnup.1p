   NAME
     psnup-print multiple pages on a sheet of paper.

   SYNOPSIS
     psnup [ -rGf ] [ -n_n_u_p_s_p_e_c ] [ -S_p_a_p_e_r_s_i_z_e ] [ -s_p_a_g_e_s_i_z_e ] [ -
     w_p_a_g_e_w_i_d_t_h ] [ -h_p_a_g_e_h_e_i_g_h_t ]
     [ -p_o_u_t_p_u_t_f_i_l_e ] [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ -d_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ _f_i_l_e ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_n_u_p reads in a POSTSCRIPT language _f_i_l_e (or the standard input if no
     file is named) and, if the input conforms to the POSTSCRIPT language
     document structuring conventions, provides page rotation, printing of
     multiple pages on a sheet of paper (n-up printing), selection of page
     and paper sizes, and writes the resulting file on the standard output.
     The output may be directed to a file.

     The possible options are:

     -n_n_u_p_s_p_e_c
          _n_u_p_s_p_e_c may be a single number specifying how many pages will be
          printed on each sheet of paper, or a specification  of the form: _n
          x _m, where _n and _m specify rows and columns, respectively. Rows
          refers to the number of page images across a sheet of paper,
          columns to the number of page images down a sheet of paper.  The
          specification -n_2_x_2 is  equivalent to the specification -n_4.  If
          the number of pages on a sheet is specified as a single number, the
          number must be a power of 2.

     -r   rotates the page 90 degrees (landscape mode).  When using the n-up
          capability of _p_s_n_u_p, this option is preferable to the landscape
          option of pslpr because the rotation of the page is taken into
          account when laying out multiple pages on a sheet of paper.

     -S_p_a_p_e_r_s_i_z_e
          specifies size of paper for which output is to be formatted.  The
          default is Letter (8.5 x 11).

     -s_p_a_g_e_s_i_z_e
          specifies the size of pages being printed n-up (i.e., the original
          size).  The default is Letter (8.5 x 11).

     -w_p_a_g_e_w_i_d_t_h
          if the size of the pages being printed n-up isn't a standard size,
          you can specify the width and height instead.  Numbers followed by
          "i" will be interpreted in inches, by "m" in millimeters, and
          numbers without qualification will be interpreted as specifying the
          distance in points.

     -h_p_a_g_e_h_e_i_g_h_t
          specifies the height of the page being printed n-up.

     -G   formats the document in psnup's "gaudy" mode, with borders around
          the virtual pages.  If no n-up specification is given, the input
          file is printed with four virtual pages per sheet of paper.

     -p_o_u_t_p_u_t_f_i_l_e
          writes output to the specified file.  -p- means write output to
          standard output.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e

     -d_p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e
          uses _p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e'_s POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file for informa-
          tion about available paper sizes.  The result is _n_o_t spooled to the
          printer.


   EXAMPLES
     The following command reads a POSTSCRIPT language file called
     printfile.ps and formats it with four pages on a sheet of paper.  The
     file is piped through pslpr to be printed on the printer called ps.

          psnup -n4 printfile.ps | pslpr -Pps

     In this example, a text file is processed by enscript, creating a
     POSTSCRIPT language file, which is piped to _p_s_n_u_p, which rotates the
     file and formats it with three virtual pages across and two virtual
     pages down the paper.  The formatted file is printed by piping the file
     through pslpr.

          enscript -p- textfile | psnup -r -n3x2 | pslpr

     In this example, a text file is processed by enscript, creating a
     POSTSCRIPT language file, which is piped to _p_s_n_u_p, formatted in gaudy
     mode ( -G option), with four virtual pages per actual page of output.
     The formatted file is printed by piping the file through pslpr.  The
     result is printed pages with four original text pages on each sheet,
     with each original text page surrounded by a border.

          enscript -p- textfile | psnup -G -n4 | pslpr
