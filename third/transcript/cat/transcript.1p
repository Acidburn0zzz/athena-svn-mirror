   NAME
     TRANSCRIPT-Programs for accessing POSTSCRIPT printers

   DESCRIPTION
     The TRANSCRIPT package is a suite of UNIX programs that enables UNIX
     systems to access state-of-the-art POSTSCRIPT printers.  The package
     transforms UNIX documents and graphics files into POSTSCRIPT language
     format.  The POSTSCRIPT language is a device-independent programming
     language and print file format for describing the appearance of printed
     pages. POSTSCRIPT language documents can combine text, graphics, line
     art, and scanned images for printing on raster devices.  POSTSCRIPT
     language files will print _w_i_t_h_o_u_t _m_o_d_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n on any POSTSCRIPT
     printer.

     The TRANSCRIPT package includes translator filters for common UNIX docu-
     ment file formats like troff, ditroff, and plot.  It also includes
     filters for "line-printer" listings, Diablo 630 print files, and Tek-
     tronix 4014 files.  TRANSCRIPT software is fully integrated into the
     spooling architecture, and includes the communications filters necessary
     to print job banner pages, do page accounting, and perform communication
     with a POSTSCRIPT printer.

     The following programs are provided with the TRANSCRIPT release.  See
     the appropriate manual page for each filter for more details.

     _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t
            converts plain text files into POSTSCRIPT language format. Fonts,
            headings, and limited formatting options may be specified, as
            well as spooling options.

     _p_s_4_0_1_4 converts Tektronix 4014 graphics terminal commands into
            POSTSCRIPT language format.

     _p_s_6_3_0  converts Diablo 630 word processing files into POSTSCRIPT
            language format.

     _p_s_p_l_o_t converts UNIX plot(1) format files into POSTSCRIPT language for-
            mat.

     _p_s_l_p_r  Reverse page order and/or select specified pages in POSTSCRIPT
            language format files .  Pslpr also provides other document
            management services such as font downloading, downloading of
            other resources such as procedure sets, and handling of printer-
            specific features.  It is similar in function to psdman, but is
            invoked by the user, so the user has more control over things
            such as where fonts and resources are obtained.  These services
            are provided for documents that conform to the Document Structur-
            ing Conventions.  See the pslpr(1) manual page for a more com-
            plete description of this filter and its various functions.

   TRANSCRIPT(1)                                               19 August 1992


     _p_s_n_u_p  prints multiple virtual pages on a single page, for documents
            that conform to the Document Structuring Conventions.  See the
            psnup(1) manual page for a more complete description of this
            filter and its various functions.

     _p_s_r_o_f_f converts [di]troff(1) input into POSTSCRIPT language format.
            This is actually a shell script.  See the psroff(1) manual page
            for more information.

     _p_t_r_o_f_f converts [o]troff(1) input into POSTSCRIPT language format.  This
            is actually a shell script.  See the ptroff(1) manual page for
            more information.

     _p_s_f_a_x  prepares documents for sending as FAX transmissions from
            POSTSCRIPT printers with fax capabilities.  See the psfax(1)
            manual page for more information.

     _p_s_d_r_a_f_tadds a draft string to a document. See the psdraft(1) manual page
            for more information.

     _p_p_a_n_e_l a Motif graphical user interface to the TRANSCRIPT programs.  See
            the ppanel(1) manual page for more information.

     _p_s_c_o_m_m the program that performs serial communication with the
            POSTSCRIPT printer.  This is normally invisible to the casual
            user.  See the pscomm(8) manual page for a more complete descrip-
            tion.  _q_m_s_c_o_m_m the program that performs network communication
            with a QMS POSTSCRIPT printer.  This is normally invisible to the
            casual user.  See the qmscomm(8) manual page for a more complete
            description.  _f_p_c_o_m_m the program that performs network communica-
            tion with a POSTSCRIPT printer connected via a MiLAN FastPort
            box.  This is normally invisible to the casual user.  See the
            fpcomm(8) manual page for a more complete description.  _l_p_c_o_m_m
            the program that performs parallel communication with the
            POSTSCRIPT printer.  This is normally invisible to the casual
            user.  See the lpcomm(8) manual page for a more complete descrip-
            tion.  _c_a_p_c_o_m_m the program that performs Appletalk communication
            with the POSTSCRIPT printer.  This is normally invisible to the
            casual user.  See the capcomm(8) manual page for a more complete
            description.

     _p_s_d_m_a_n the TRANSCRIPT document manager.  Invoked by psinterface (System
            V), or psint.sh (BSD) to process print files.  Calls enscript to
            convert text files to POSTSCRIPT language format, if necessary.
            psdman is normally invisible to the user and is not intended to
            be invoked in a command line.  Psdman performs document manage-
            ment functions such as page reversal (if desired), font download-
            ing, other resource downloading, and handling of printer-specific
            features for documents that conform to the Document Structuring
            Conventions.  See the psdman(8) manual page for a more complete
            description.
