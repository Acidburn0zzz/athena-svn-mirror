   NAME
     ptroff-troff to a POSTSCRIPT printer

   SYNOPSIS
     ptroff [ -t ] [ -F_f_a_m_i_l_y ] [ _t_r_o_f_f _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _s_p_o_o_l _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_t_r_o_f_f is a shell script that runs [o]troff(1) in an environment to pro-
     duce output on a POSTSCRIPT printer.  It uses pscat to convert troff
     C/A/T output to a POSTSCRIPT language print file, and spools this for
     printing.  If no _f_i_l_e_s are specified, the standard input is used.

     In addition to the standard [o]troff options, the following options are
     understood by _p_t_r_o_f_f.

     -t   sends the POSTSCRIPT language output to the standard output, rather
          than spooling it to a printer.  Note that this overrides the mean-
          ing of the troff -t option; if you want the C/A/T file, run
          [o]troff directly.

     -F_f_o_n_t_f_a_m_i_l_y
          names a font family to load into [o]troff and pscat.  _F_o_n_t_f_a_m_i_l_y is
          used to name both a *.head file containing troff "fp" commands, and
          a *.ct file containing a character mapping for pscat.  Font fami-
          lies "Times" and "Helvetica" are probably defined at your site;
          others may be available.

     In 4.2bsd UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
     lpr.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          causes the output to be sent to the named printer.

     -#_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -h   suppresses the printing of the job burst page.

     -C_c_l_a_s_s
          sets the job classification for use on the burst page.

     -J_n_a_m_e
          sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name
          of the first input file will be used.

     -m   sends mail after files have been printed.

     In System V UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
     lp.

     -d_d_e_s_t

          causes the output to be sent to the named destination.

     -n_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -h   suppresses the printing of the job burst page.

     -r   don't page-reverse the output.

     -s   suppresses messages from lp.

     -m   sends mail after files have been printed.

     -w   writes to the user's terminal after files have been printed.

   ENVIRONMENT

     PRINTER (BSD)
          the name of a printer (as in the -P option) for lpr to use.  If no
          -P option is specified, lpr will use this printer.  If neither -P
          nor PRINTER is set, _p_t_r_o_f_f will spool to a printer named
          "PostScript".

     LPDEST (System V)
          the name of a printer (as in the n -d option) for lp to use.  If no
          -d option is specified, lp will use this printer.  If neither -d
          nor LPDEST is set, _p_t_r_o_f_f will spool to a printer class named
          "PostScript".

   FILES

     XTROFFFONTDIRX/*.ct   character correspondence tables for pscat.

     XTROFFFONTDIRX/*.head troff headers containing ".fp" commands.

     XTROFFFONTDIRX/ftXX   font width files for troff.

     XPSLIBDIRX/pscat.pro  default POSTSCRIPT language prologue for pscat.

   BUGS
     Because of the character mapping tables used, explicit use of the ".fp"
     troff directive will usually produce the wrong result.  Users must build
     and reference correct tables with _p_s_c_a_t_m_a_p(8) for non-standard ".fp"
     combinations to work.

     More flexibility is allowed by using _t_r_o_f_f, _p_s_c_a_t, and the spooler
     separately.
