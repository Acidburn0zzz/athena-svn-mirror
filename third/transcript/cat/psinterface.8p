   NAME
     psinterface-TRANSCRIPT spooler filters for POSTSCRIPT printers

   SYNOPSIS
     psinterface

   DESCRIPTION
     The _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e shell script is the printer interface program as sup-
     plied to lpadmin.  The options are as specified in the _L_i_n_e _P_r_i_n_t_e_r
     _S_p_o_o_l_i_n_g _U_t_i_l_i_t_i_e_s _G_u_i_d_e. This shell script reads a printer-specific
     shell script named transcript/_p_r_i_n_t_e_r.opt below the current working
     directory (the lp spooling directory) which may do additional printer-
     specific processing.  The _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.opt script is often used to redefine
     the values of some environment variables that regulate page-reversal,
     how to print banner pages, etc. for specific printers.  See below.

     _P_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e is responsible for the complete processing of the print job,
     invoking programs to accomplish banner pages, document management, and
     communications. If job banner break pages are enabled for this printer
     (and requested for this job), _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e will invoke psbanner to format
     a banner break page.  _P_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e currently recognizes three
     TRANSCRIPT-specific spooling options (presented to lp with the -o flag).
     The h option suppresses the printing of a banner break page, the r
     option suppresses page reversal, and the m option causes _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e to
     send any stream output from the execution of the user's POSTSCRIPT print
     file back to the user as mail.

     The _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e script also invokes a communications program for commun-
     icating with the printer.  Communications programs are provided for
     serial communications, Centronix parallel communications, Appletalk com-
     munications, and Ethernet communications with either a QMS printer or a
     MiLAN FastPort printer server. _P_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e and the communications pro-
     gram manage a printer log file named transcript/_p_r_i_n_t_e_r-log (under the
     lp spooling directory).  This file contains a log of each job processed,
     as well as any error output from the printer.  In particular, it con-
     tains messages regarding the printer being out of paper, jammed, etc.
     Doing a tail on this file will help determine the printer's status.

     psinterface Environment Variables.
     A number of environment variables are used by the spooler filters.
     These are listed below.  The _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e script sets the initial value
     for each, and the _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.opt file can be used to change the value for a
     particular printer.  Note that Bourne shell syntax must be used in both
     _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e, and the _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.opt file.  Many of the variables take a
     number value and specify whether or not an action should take place; 1
     means do the action and 0 means don't do it.

     BANNERFIRST=_n_u_m_b_e_r    print a banner at start of the job
     BANNERLAST=_n_u_m_b_e_r     print a banner at end of the job
     BANNERPRO=_f_i_l_e _n_a_m_e   banner prologue file

     VERBOSELOG=_n_u_m_b_e_r     print verbose log messages
     PSTEMPDIR=_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y _n_a_m_edirectory for temporary files

     You can change the banner page for a particular printer by redefining
     the BANNERPRO value.
