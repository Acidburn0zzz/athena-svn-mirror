   NAME
     psint-TRANSCRIPT interface script for POSTSCRIPT printers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/ps?f

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT interface script for use by the BSD
     line printer spooling system through the printer description file
     /etc/printcap . The _p_s?_f entries in XPSLIBDIRX are all links to the
     _p_s_i_n_t._s_h shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the name it was
     invoked under) to determine which action to take.  The options are as
     specified in the _4._2_B_S_D _L_i_n_e _P_r_i_n_t_e_r _S_p_o_o_l_e_r _M_a_n_u_a_l. This shell script
     reads a printer-specific shell script named in the current working
     directory (the spooling directory) which may do additional printer-
     specific processing.  The .options script is often used to redefine the
     values of some environment variables that regulate page-reversal, how to
     print banner pages, etc.  See below.

     The _p_s_o_f entry is responsible for formatting a banner break page.  It
     executes the psbanner filter which leaves the banner page in a file
     named ".banner" for the communications program to print.  The _p_s_i_n_t._s_h
     interface script is responsible for invoking programs to do translation
     if necessary, document management, and communication with the printer.

     _p_s_g_f, _p_s_n_f, and _p_s_t_f are the filters for plot (5), ditroff (1), and
     troff (1) respectively. The _p_s_i_f filter will also accept any POSTSCRIPT
     language print file.  Other filter entries, such as those for TeX DVI
     files, cifplot, and raw raster data are not available in the TRANSCRIPT
     package, although they may be available from other sources.  The default
     action for these filter types is to execute psbad, a script that prints
     and logs an error message that the translation filter is not available.
     The translation filters are usually invoked by giving an option to
     lpr(1).  It is not correct to invoke the interface filters directly.
     More flexibility in format conversion may be achieved by invoking the
     appropriate translator directly, rather than specifying an lpr option.

     psint.sh Environment Variables.
     A number of environment variables are used by the spooler filters.
     These are listed below.  The _p_s_i_n_t._s_h script sets the initial value for
     each, and the .options file can be used to change the value for a par-
     ticular printer.  Note that Bourne shell syntax must be used in both
     _p_s_i_n_t._s_h and the .options file.  Many of the variables take a numerical
     value and specify whether an action should take place or not; 1 means do
     the action and 0 means don't do it.

     BANNERFIRST=_n_u_m_b_e_r    Print a banner at start of the job
     BANNERLAST=_n_u_m_b_e_r     Print a banner at end of the job
     (see note below)      0=no banner at the end
                           1=don't unlink the .banner file

                           2=unlink .banner after use
     BANNERPRO=_f_i_l_e _n_a_m_e   banner prologue file
     VERBOSELOG=_n_u_m_b_e_r     print verbose log messages
     PSCOMM=_p_a_t_h _n_a_m_e      specify the communication program to be used.
     PSDMAN=_p_a_t_h _n_a_m_e      specify the document management program to be
     used.  This is useful for specifying various switches to psdman(8).

     Note: Due to some problems with the design of lpd(8), there is no imple-
     mentation of BANNERLAST that will work in all cases.  Two options are
     provided:

     BANNERLAST=1. This prints out a banner between each copy in a multiple-
     copy job.  It also may print out _t_h_e _p_r_e_v_i_o_u_s _u_s_e_r'_s banner on a job
     that has specified no banner (lpr -h).

     BANNERLAST=2.  This never prints a banner on a job that has specified no
     banner (lpr -h).  However, it prints a banner after _t_h_e _f_i_r_s_t _c_o_p_y only
     in a multiple-copy job.  It should be after all copies or after the
     final copy.

     You can change the banner page for a particular printer by redefining
     the BANNERPRO value.
