   NAME
     psplot-convert plot(5) files to POSTSCRIPT language format

   SYNOPSIS
     psplot [ -g_p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_p_l_o_t reads _f_i_l_e_s in plot(5) format and converts them to POSTSCRIPT
     language format on the standard output.  If no _f_i_l_e_s are specified, the
     standard input is used.  The conversion is almost one-for-one, with one
     POSTSCRIPT language function call for each plot primitive.  The behavior
     of the generated file can be modified by changing the definitions of the
     POSTSCRIPT language functions in the prologue.  If no -g option is
     specified, the default prologue is used.

   ENVIRONMENT

     PSLIBDIR
          path name of a directory to use instead of XPSLIBDIRX for the
          _p_s_p_l_o_t prologue file

   FILES

     XPSLIBDIRX/psplot.pro default prologue file

   BUGS
     _p_l_o_t format has been removed from some newer UNIX systems (e.g., Systems
     V), but _p_s_p_l_o_t lives on.
