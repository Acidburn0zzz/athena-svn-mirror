   NAME
     psroff-ditroff to a POSTSCRIPT printer

   SYNOPSIS
     psroff [ -t ] [ _t_r_o_f_f _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _s_p_o_o_l _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_r_o_f_f is a shell script that runs [di]troff(1) in an environment to
     produce output on a POSTSCRIPT printer.  It uses psdit to convert ditr-
     off intermediate output to POSTSCRIPT language format and spools this
     for printing.  If no _f_i_l_e_s are specified, the standard input is used.

     For those interested in including arbitrary POSTSCRIPT language commands
     or files in a ditroff document, see psdit(1).

     In addition to the standard ditroff options, the following options are
     understood by _p_s_r_o_f_f.

     -t   sends the POSTSCRIPT language file to the standard output, rather
          than spooling it to a printer.  Note that this overrides the mean-
          ing of the ditroff -t option; if you want that, run ditroff
          directly.

     -F_f_o_n_t_f_a_m_i_l_y
          use the specified font family for the R/I/B/BI fonts, rather than
          the default family, which is Times.  Font families Times, Courier,
          and Helvetica are probably defined at your site, and others may be
          available as well.  Make sure the printer you will use contains the
          font family you pick.  Note that this overrides the meaning of the
          ditroff -F option; if you want that, run ditroff directly, or use
          the -D option.

     -D_f_o_n_t_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y
          finds font family directories in the specified _f_o_n_t_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y rather
          than the standard font directory which was configured in the
          installation procedure.  Note that it may be necessary to use both
          this option and the -F option to imitate the -F option in ditroff.

     In BSD UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to lpr.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          causes the output to be sent to the named printer.

     -#_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -h   suppresses the printing of the job burst page.

     -C_c_l_a_s_s
          set the job classification for use on the burst page.

     -J_n_a_m_e
          sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name
          of the first input file will be used.

     -m   sends mail after files have been printed.

     In System V UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
     lp.

     -d_d_e_s_t
          causes the output to be sent to the named destination.

     -n_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -h   suppresses the printing of the job burst page.

     -r   don't page-reverse the output.

     -s   suppresses messages from lp.

     -m   sends mail after files have been printed.

     -w   writes to user's terminal after files have been printed.

   ENVIRONMENT

     PRINTER (BSD)
          the name of a printer (as in the -P option) for lpr to use.  If no
          -P option is specified, lpr will use this printer.  If neither -P
          nor PRINTER is set, _p_s_r_o_f_f will spool to a printer named
          "PostScript".

     LPDEST (System V)
          the name of a printer (as in the -d option) for lp to use.  If no
          -d option is specified, lp will use this printer.  If neither -d
          nor LPDEST is set, _p_s_r_o_f_f will spool to a printer class named
          "PostScript".

   BUGS
     The eqn supplied with ditroff is different from the original.  Use the
     options -r576 -m2 for best results.  Other programs (e.g., pic ) distri-
     buted with ditroff have the device names compiled in (so much for device
     independence!).  They should just have a -T option and read the device
     description file for the information they need.  Use -T576 with the pic
     distributed with DWB.
