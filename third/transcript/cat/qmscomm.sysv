   NAME
     qmscomm-TRANSCRIPT Ethernet communications filter for QMS POSTSCRIPT
     printers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/qmscomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT Ethernet communication filter for use
     by the System V line printer spooling system when communicating with a
     QMS POSTSCRIPT printer.  It is called from the psinterface shell script.
     The program _q_m_s_c_o_m_m is the lowest level filter.  It manages communica-
     tion with the printer and status reporting.  psinterface and _q_m_s_c_o_m_m
     manage a printer log file named transcript/_p_r_i_n_t_e_r-log (under the lp
     spooling directory).  This file contains a log of each job processed.
