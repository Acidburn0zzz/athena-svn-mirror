   NAME
     pslpr-select or reverse the page order of a POSTSCRIPT language file

   SYNOPSIS
     pslpr [ -LRfGazequ ] [ -i_p_a_g_e_r_a_n_g_e ] [ -S_f_e_a_t_u_r_e=_v_a_l_u_e ] [ -
     I_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_p_a_t_h ] [ -p_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e ]
     [ _s_p_o_o_l_o_p_t_s ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_l_p_r reads in the specified POSTSCRIPT language _f_i_l_e (or the standard
     input if no file is named) and, if the input conforms to the POSTSCRIPT
     language document structuring conventions, provides page order reversal,
     landscape orientation, and selection of specified pages for printing.
     Font and other resource downloading is supported as well as inclusion of
     printer-specific features such as manual feed.  _p_s_l_p_r also supports
     ASCII85 encoding and LZW compression for Level 2 printers.  _p_s_l_p_r sends
     output to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e if the -p option is used; otherwise the output is
     printed on the printer specified by either the
     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r option for BSD or the -d_d_e_s_t option of System V. If none of
     these options is used, _p_s_l_p_r prints on the printer specified by the
     PRINTER environment variable, if present, or to a printer named
     "PostScript".

     The possible options are:

     -i_p_a_g_e_r_a_n_g_e
          _p_a_g_e_r_a_n_g_e may be a single page number or a range of the form "N-M"
          which means print pages N through M.  Multiple instances of
          _p_a_g_e_r_a_n_g_e may be specified by repetitive use of this option.

     -R   reverses the page order.

     -L   prints the document in landscape format.  Use of this option when
          processing a POSTSCRIPT language document that describes a page
          which is longer than the width of the paper being used will result
          in truncation at the top of the printed page.  You can use the -u
          switch to force the truncation of the bottom of the page instead of
          the top, or the -q option to shrink the image to fit in the width
          of the paper.  When using the n-up capabilitiy of psnup, it is
          preferable to also use the rotate option of psnup rather than the
          landscape option of _p_s_l_p_r because the rotation of the page is taken
          into account by psnup when laying out multiple pages on a sheet of
          paper.

     -l_r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e_p_a_t_h
          specifies the path name for a printer resource.  If the resource is
          not available in the printer, as defined in the printer's
          POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file, _p_s_l_p_r will download the
          resource to the printer.

     -p_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          sends the document to the specified file, instead of printing it.
          If -p- is specified, output is directed to standard output.

     -f   forces _p_s_l_p_r to proceed despite errors.

     -F   don't perform any manipulation of the document-no page reversal,
          font downloading, etc.

     -G   don't rearrange.  _p_s_l_p_r will attempt to rearrange downloaded fonts
          to minimize transmission time if the printer has enough memory. the
          -G option disables this feature.

     -a   strips comments.  Strips out all lines that begin with "%".  This
          should not be used if later processing of this document is
          expected.

     -z   performs LZW compression and ASCII85 encoding of the document.
          This feature is available only in Level 2 printers.

     -e   adds showpage.  This is useful when printing Encapsulated
          POSTSCRIPT files, which may or may not have a showpage in them.

     -q   shrinks to fit.  This is used in conjunction with landscape mode.
          When specified, the image will be scaled to fit on the rotated
          page.

     -u   overtranslates when rotating.  The default behavior when landscape
          is specified is to translate the axis so that the bottom left
          corner of the rotated page corresponds with the origin.  If this
          switch is specified, the axis will be translated beyond that, so
          that the point in the coordinate space that matched the upper left
          corner of the unrotated page will match the upper left corner of
          the rotated page.  This is useful when rotating images produced by
          programs whose idea of the origin of the coordinate space is at the
          top of the page, rather than the bottom, as in the POSTSCRIPT
          language imaging model.

     -S_f_e_a_t_u_r_e=_v_a_l_u_e
          Sets a printer-specific feature, such as manual feed.  If no value
          is specified, a value of "TRUE" is assumed.  Any feature named in
          the target printer's POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file can be
          used here.

     In BSD UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to lpr.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          causes the output to be sent to the named printer, unless _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
          is specified; in which case, the printer name is used to access the
          printer's POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file for information, and
          the output is written to the specified file instead of being
          spooled for printing.

     -#_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -h   suppresses the printing of the job burst page.

     -C_c_l_a_s_s
          sets the job classification for use on the burst page.

     -J_n_a_m_e
          sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name
          of the first input file will be used.

     -m   sends mail after files have been printed.

     -r   renames the file after printing.

     In System V UNIX systems, the following spooler options are passed on to
     lp.  See the man pages for LP(C) and LPR(W) for more complete descrip-
     tions.

     -d_d_e_s_t
          causes the output to be sent to the named printer unless -p_f_i_l_e is
          specified; in which case, the printer name is used to access the
          printer's POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file for information, and
          the output is written to the specified file instead of being
          spooled for printing.

     -c   immediately makes a copy of the file to be printed.

     -n_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -h   suppresses the printing of the job burst page.

     -r   don't page-reverse the output.

     -s   suppresses messages from lp.

     -m   sends mail after files have been printed.

     -t_t_i_t_l_e
          specifies the title.

     -w   writes to the user's terminal after files have been printed.

     -o_o_p_t_i_o_n
          sends a printer-dependent or class dependent option to print
          spooler.


   EXAMPLES
     The following command reads a POSTSCRIPT language file called
     printfile.ps and prints pages 3 through 19, 37 through 60 and page 90,
     in landscape format.  The -d option (System V only; for BSD use the -P
     option) directs the output to the printer called ps, and is required
     when using the -L option.

          pslpr -i3-19 -i37-60 -i90 -L -dps  printfile.ps


   Adobe Systems                                                            3

     In the next example, a textfile is processed by enscript, creating a
     POSTSCRIPT language file which is piped to _p_s_l_p_r and printed page-
     reversed on the printer named LaserBlaster. The first line in the exam-
     ple is for BSD, the second for System V.

          enscript -p- textfile | pslpr -R -PLaserBlaster

          enscript -p- textfile | pslpr -R -dLaserBlaster

     In this example, a POSTSCRIPT language file (doc.ps) is prepared for
     printing on a specific printer (LaserBlaster), but is saved in a file
     (LBprintfile), instead of being spooled for printing.  Again, the first
     line in the example is for BSD, the second for System V.

          pslpr -pLBprintfile -PLaserBlaster doc.ps

          pslpr -pLBprintfile -dLaserBlaster doc.ps


   ENVIRONMENT

     PSRESOURCEPATH
          path name to use for accessing printer resource information for
          downloadable resources

     PSTEMPDIR
          path name of a temporary directory to use instead of XPSTEMPDIRX
          for spooled temporary files

     PRINTER (BSD)
          the name of a printer (as in the -P option) for lpr to use.  If no
          -P option is specified, lpr will use this printer.  If neither -P
          nor PRINTER is set, _p_s_l_p_r will spool to a printer named
          "PostScript".

     LPDEST (System V)
          the name of a printer (as in the -d option) for lp to use.  If no
          -d option is specified, lp will use this printer.  If neither -d
          nor LPDEST is set, _p_s_l_p_r will spool to a printer class named
          "PostScript".
