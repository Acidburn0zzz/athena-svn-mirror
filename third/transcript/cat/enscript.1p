   NAME
     enscript-convert text files to POSTSCRIPT language format for printing

   SYNOPSIS
     enscript [ -1BcGghlmoqRr2 ] [ -v_c_o_l_u_m_n_s ] [ -L_l_i_n_e_s ] [ -f_b_f_o_n_t ] [ -
     F_h_f_o_n_t ] [ -b_h_e_a_d_e_r ] [ -p_o_u_t ]
     [ -s_s_i_z_e ] [ -S_f_e_a_t_u_r_e=_v_a_l_u_e ] [ -T_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s ] [ _s_p_o_o_l_o_p_t_s ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t reads in plain text files, converts them to POSTSCRIPT
     language, and spools them for printing on a POSTSCRIPT printer.  Fonts,
     headings, limited formatting options, and spooling options may be speci-
     fied.

     For example:
          enscript -Paleph boring.txt
     prints a copy of the file called boring.txt on the printer called aleph.
          enscript -2r boring.c
     prints a two-up landscape listing of the file called boring.c on the
     default printer (see below).

     Font specifications have two parts: a font name as known to the
     POSTSCRIPT printer (e.g., Times-Roman, Times-BoldItalic, Helvetica,
     Courier), and a point size (1 point=1/72 inch; 8 point is a good small
     point size).  So Courier-Bold8 is 8 point Courier Bold, Helvetica12 is
     12 point Helvetica.

     The environment variable ENSCRIPT may be used to specify defaults.  The
     value of ENSCRIPT is parsed as a string of arguments _b_e_f_o_r_e the argu-
     ments that appear on the command line.  For example "ENSCRIPT='-fTimes-
     Roman8'" sets the default body font to 8 point Times Roman.

     The possible options are:

     -1   sets in 1 column. One column is the default.

     -2   sets in 2 columns.

     -v_c_o_l_u_m_n_s
          output is set in _c_o_l_u_m_n_s number of columns.  This is an extension
          of the -2 switch.

     -r   rotates the output 90 degrees (landscape mode).  This is good for
          output that requires a wide page or for program listings when used
          in conjunction with -2.
          " enscript -2r files " is a nice way to get program listings.

     -R   don't rotate, also known as portrait mode (the default).

     -G   prints in gaudy mode: causes page headings, dates, and page numbers

          to be printed in a flashy style, at some slight performance
          expense.

     -l   simulates a line printer: make pages 66 lines long and omit
          headers.

     -B   omits page headings.

     -c   truncates ("cuts") lines that are longer than the page width.  Nor-
          mally, long lines are wrapped around to the following line on the
          page.

     -b_h_e_a_d_e_r
          sets the string to be used for page headings to _h_e_a_d_e_r.  The
          default header is constructed from the file name, its last modifi-
          cation date, and a page number.  You can include elements from the
          default header in your header by specifying %f for file name, %d
          for date, or %n for page number.  If you need a '%' character in
          the header, it must be specified by "%%".

     -L_l_i_n_e_s
          set the maximum number of lines to output on a page.  _E_n_s_c_r_i_p_t usu-
          ally computes how many lines to put on a page based on point size,
          and may put fewer lines per page than requested by _l_i_n_e_s.

     -f_b_f_o_n_t
          sets the font to be used for the body of each page.  The default is
          Courier10 unless two-column rotated mode is used, in which case the
          default is Courier7.

     -F_h_f_o_n_t
          sets the font to be used for page headings.  The default is
          Courier-Bold10.

     -p_o_u_t
          causes the POSTSCRIPT file to be written to the named file rather
          than being spooled for printing.  As a special case, -p will send
          the resultingPOSTSCRIPT language code to the standard output.

     -g   causes the fact that a file is garbage to be ignored.  Normally,
          any file with more than a small number of nonprinting characters is
          suspected of being garbage and not printed; this option means
          "print it anyway."

     -o   if _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t cannot find characters in a font, the missing charac-
          ters are listed.

     -q   causes _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t to be quiet about what it is doing. _E_n_s_c_r_i_p_t won't
          report about pages, destination, omitted characters, etc. Fatal
          errors are still reported to the standard error output.

     -h   suppresses printing of the job burst page.

          chooses a paper size for printing.  This size must match one of the
          *PaperSize keywords in the POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file,
          such as Letter, Legal, or A4.

     -S_f_e_a_t_u_r_e=_v_a_l_u_e
          chooses a printer feature, such as manual feed or duplex.  If _v_a_l_u_e
          is omitted, a value of true is assumed.  These features must match
          a keyword in the POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file.  For example,
          "enscript -S ManualFeed" turns on manual feed.

     -T_c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s
          sets the width of a tab to be _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s
           number of characters.  This is especially useful to get columns to
          line up correctly when printing with a variable width font.

     In BSD Unix systems, the following spooler options are also recognized:

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          causes the output to be sent to the named printer unless -p_f_i_l_e is
          specified. In that case, the printer name is used to access the
          printer's POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file for information, and
          the output is written to the specified file instead of being
          spooled for printing.

     -#_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced.  The default is one.

     -m   causes the printer daemon to send mail upon job completion.

     -J_n_a_m_e
          sets the job name for use on the burst page.  Otherwise, the name
          of the first input file will be used.

     -C_c_l_a_s_s
          set the job classification for use on the burst page.

     In System V Unix systems, the following spooler options are also recog-
     nized:

     -t_t_i_t_l_e
          sets job title for use on the burst page.

     -d_d_e_s_t
          causes the output to be sent to the named printer or printer class
          unless -p_f_i_l_e is specified. In that case, the printer name is used
          to access the printer's POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file for
          information, and the output is written to the specified file
          instead of being spooled for printing.

     -n_n  causes _n copies of the output to be produced. The default is one.

     -w or -m
          causes the printer daemon to write or send mail upon job comple-
          tion.

   ENVIRONMENT

     ENSCRIPT
          string of options to be used by _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t

     PSLIBDIR
          path name of a directory to use instead of XPSLIBDIRX for _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t
          prologue and font metric files

     PSTEMPDIR
          path name of a temporary directory to use instead of XPSTEMPDIRX
          for temporary files.

     PRINTER (BSD)
          the name of a printer (as in the -P option) for lpr to use.  If no
          -P option is specified, lpr will use this printer.  If neither -P
          nor PRINTER is set, _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t will spool to a printer named
          "PostScript".

     LPDEST (System V)
          the name of a printer (as in the -d option) for lp to use.  If no
          -d option is specified, lp will use this printer.  If neither -d
          nor LPDEST is set, _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t will spool to a printer class named
          "PostScript".

   FILES

     XPSLIBDIRX/*.afm      font metrics files

     XPSLIBDIRX/enscript.pro
                           prologue for _e_n_s_c_r_i_p_t
                            files

   BUGS
     _E_n_s_c_r_i_p_t generates temporary files which are spooled for printing.  The
     temporary file names are used by the spooling software (e.g., lpq ),
     rather than the symbolic job name passed to lpr .

     There are too many options.
