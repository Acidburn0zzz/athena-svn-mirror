   NAME
     psdraft - add "draft" notices on POSTSCRIPT language documents

   SYNOPSIS
     psdraft [ -s_s_t_r_i_n_g ] [ -x_x_c_o_o_r_d ] [ -y_y_c_o_o_r_d ] [ -f_f_o_n_t ] [ -r_a_n_g_l_e ] [
     -g_g_r_a_y_l_e_v_e_l ] [ -o ] [ -p_o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_d_r_a_f_t reads in conforming POSTSCRIPT language files and inserts
     POSTSCRIPT language code to print a string such as "DRAFT" in the mar-
     gins, or anywhere on the page.

     For example:
          psdraft text.ps
     produces a POSTSCRIPT file that, in addition to the image already
     described in text.ps, prints the string "DRAFT" rotated 90 degrees in
     the right margin.
          psdraft -s"Adobe Confidential" -r45 -x252 -y324 text.ps
     produces a POSTSCRIPT file that includes the string "Adobe Confidential"
     in the middle of the page, rotated 45 degrees.

     The possible options are:

     -s_s_t_r_i_n_g
          puts _s_t_r_i_n_g on the paper.  The default is "DRAFT".

     -r_a_n_g_l_e
          rotates the string _a_n_g_l_e degrees.  The default is 90.

     -x_x_c_o_o_r_d
          puts the string at the _x_c_o_o_r_d x-coordinate on the page.  The
          default is 575.

     -y_y_c_o_o_r_d
          puts the string at the _y_c_o_o_r_d y-coordinate on the page.  The
          default is 300.

     -g_g_r_a_y_l_e_v_e_l
          specifies the gray level for printing the string.  The default is 0
          (black).

     -f_f_o_n_t
          sets the font to be used for printing the string.  The default is
          Times-Roman30.

          Font specifications have two parts: a font name as known to the
          POSTSCRIPT printer (e.g., Times-Roman, Times-BoldItalic, Helvetica,
          Courier), and a point size (1 point=1/72 inch; 8 point is a good
          small point size).  So Courier-Bold8 is 8 point Courier Bold, Hel-
          vetica12 is 12 point Helvetica.

     -o   specify that the outline of the font should be used.  Default is
          not to use outline.

     -p_o_u_t
          causes the POSTSCRIPT file to be written to the named file rather
          than being spooled for printing.  As a special case, -p- will send
          the POSTSCRIPT language document to the standard output (which is
          the default behavior).

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          specifies that _p_s_d_r_a_f_t should get information about the dimensions
          of the paper from the POSTSCRIPT Printer Description file for
          _p_r_i_n_t_e_r. This information is necessary to do rotation.
