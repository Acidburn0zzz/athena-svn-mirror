   NAME
     capcomm-TRANSCRIPT Appletalk communication filter for POSTSCRIPT
     printers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/pscomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT Appletalk communication filter for use
     by the 4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer descrip-
     tion file /etc/printcap.  It uses the CAP libraries to communicate with
     printers connected to Appletalk networks.  It is called from the
     _p_s_i_n_t._s_h shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the name it was
     invoked under) to determine which action to take, which may involve
     invoking a translation filter or management filter before invoking the
     communications filter. The options are as specified in the _4._2_B_S_D _L_i_n_e
     _P_r_i_n_t_e_r _S_p_o_o_l_e_r _M_a_n_u_a_l. The program _p_s_c_o_m_m is the lowest level filter.
     It manages communication with the printer, error handling, status
     reporting, etc.
