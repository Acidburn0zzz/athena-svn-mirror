   NAME
     qmscomm-TRANSCRIPT Ethernet communication filter for QMS POSTSCRIPT
     printers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/qmscomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT Ethernet communication filter for use
     by the 4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer descrip-
     tion file /etc/printcap in communicating with QMS Ethernet printers.  It
     is called from the psint.sh shell script.  This script uses argv[0] (the
     name it was invoked under) to determine which action to take, which may
     involve invoking a translation filter or management filter before invok-
     ing the communications filter. The options are as specified in the
     _4._2_B_S_D _L_i_n_e _P_r_i_n_t_e_r _S_p_o_o_l_e_r _M_a_n_u_a_l. The program _q_m_s_c_o_m_m is the lowest
     level filter.  It manages the communication with the printer, including
     status reporting.  Page accounting is not supported with _q_m_s_c_o_m_m.
