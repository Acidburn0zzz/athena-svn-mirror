   NAME
     psdit-convert ditroff intermediate format to POSTSCRIPT language format

   SYNOPSIS
     psdit [ -F_f_o_n_t_d_i_r ] [ -p_p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e ] [ -o_l_i_s_t ] [ _f_i_l_e ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_d_i_t translates a _f_i_l_e created by device-independent [di]troff (1) to
     POSTSCRIPT language format for printing on a POSTSCRIPT printer.  If no
     _f_i_l_e is mentioned, the standard input is used.  The POSTSCRIPT language
     file is sent to the standard output.  The options are:

     -F_f_o_n_t_d_i_r
          take font information from _f_o_n_t_d_i_r instead of the default (see
          below).

     -p_p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e
          use the contents of _p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e instead of the default POSTSCRIPT
          language prologue (see below).

     -o_l_i_s_t
          prints pages whose numbers are given in the comma-separated _l_i_s_t.
          The list contains single numbers _N and ranges _N_1-_N_2.  A missing _N_1
          means the lowest-numbered page, a missing _N_2 means the highest.

     Note: the input for _p_s_d_i_t should be prepared with the corresponding -
     Tpsc option of [ di ] troff , pic , etc.
     eqn should be run with the flags -r576 and -m2 to produce suitable out-
     put.
     pic should be run with the -D flag.  With DWB pic , use -T576 to set the
     correct resolution.

     _p_s_d_i_t allows for users to cause _t_r_o_f_f to include arbitrary POSTSCRIPT
     language code in the generated document.  _p_s_d_i_t recognizes the undefined
     "%" command in the ditroff intermediate file format to signal the start
     of raw POSTSCRIPT language to be placed _a_s _i_s in the the output file.
     Everthing between (but not including) the percent sign and a line con-
     taining a single period (".") will be placed in the generated output.
     This code is not insulated from the ditroff coordinate system or the
     state of the generated code. However, two functions are defined in the
     prologue so that users may insulate themselves if they so desire.  The
     PB function (for _p_i_c_t_u_r_e _b_e_g_i_n) will execute the POSTSCRIPT language
     operator save , translate the coordinate system to ditroff's idea of the
     current position on the page, and change the scale and orientation of
     the coordinate system axes to be the standard 72 units per inch.  The PE
     macro (for _p_i_c_t_u_r_e _e_n_d) will end this protected environment.

     Several methods may be employed to incorporate such included POSTSCRIPT
     language code into the ditroff intermediate file.  The ".sy", "\!" and
     ".cf" troff commands may be useful.  For example, the following sequence

     could be used to include the POSTSCRIPT language description of a com-
     pletely separate, printable document.  Note that the "showpage" operator
     is redefined.
          (usual troff input)
          \&
          .fl
          \!%PB
          \!/showpage{}def
          .fl
          .sy cat mypic.ps
          \!PE
          \!.
          (more regular troff input)
     This example includes _m_y_p_i_c._p_s as an illustration.  This facility is
     both powerful and useful.  Indiscriminate inclusion of badly behaving
     POSTSCRIPT language code may be dangerous to your document's health.

     _p_s_d_i_t also supports the \X feature of DWB 2.0 and has support for the
     psfig package.

   BUGS
     The versions of eqn and pic distributed with ditroff (from AT&T) have
     the device names compiled in (so much for device independence!).  They
     should just read the device description file for the information they
     need.  You should be sure to know which version of eqn you are running
     or you will get undesirable results.
     The B-splines generated by _d_i_t_r_o_f_f are drawn with an approximation.  The
     functions D~ and D~~ in the prologue need a little work.
