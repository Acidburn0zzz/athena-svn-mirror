   NAME
     fpcomm-TRANSCRIPT Ethernet communication filter for communicating with
     POSTSCRIPT printers via FastPort printer servers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/fpcomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT Ethernet communication filter for use
     by the System V or BSD line printer spooling system for communicating
     with a POSTSCRIPT printer via a MiLAN FastPort print server. It is
     called from the printer interface script for the printer.  There are a
     number of options for fpcomm that get set from the configuration file in
     the spool directory for the printer. The syntax for the .fpconfig file
     is as follows (any number of the entries can appear.)


     hostname _n_a_m_e
           specifies the IP _n_a_m_e for the FastPort.

     serial
           sends to the serial port.

     parallel
           sends to the parallel port.

     ctrld sends a control D before and after the job-this initializes the
           POSTSCRIPT printer.

     formfeed
           sends a formfeed after the job.

     dobanner
           looks for file .banner in the current working directory and sub-
           mits it before the job.

     startfile _f_i_l_e
           send _f_i_l_e before the job-this can be used to download an error
           handler, for example.

     endfile _f_i_l_e
           sends _f_i_l_e after the job.

     startstring _s_t_r_i_n_g
           sends _s_t_r_i_n_g before the job. This can be used to set printer
           modes-i.e., send escape sequences.

     endstring _s_t_r_i_n_g
           sends _s_t_r_i_n_g after the job-resets the printer through escape
           sequences to a particular mode)

     P_CLASS
           list of names of parallel printers-print on the first available.

     S_CLASS
           List of names of serial printers-print on the first available.

     mail _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e
           sends mail to _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e with any errors or the destination printer
           name if P-CLASS or S-CLASS was used.

     program _p_r_o_g_n_a_m_e
           executes _p_r_o_g_n_a_m_e for error messages or return messages.

     errorfile _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
           stores any errors that occurred in _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

     syslog
           records error messages in syslog file.


     If both startstring and startfile are set, startstring will be sent
     first followed by startfile.  If both endfile and endstring are, endfile
     will be sent before endstring.

     The syntax for escape in the start or stop strings is "M-", and the syn-
     tax for control is "C^".

     Using the .fpconfig file, you can set the printer mode, execute commands
     after printing, get notifications regarding print jobs etc.  If you do
     not want to place the .fpconfig file in the spool directory or if you
     want to call it by some other name, then you can use the PRINTER_CONFIG
     environment variable to specify the location of the configuration file.

   ENVIRONMENT

     PRINTER_CONFIG
          location of the configuration file
