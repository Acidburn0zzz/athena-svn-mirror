   NAME
     ppanel-Motif graphical user interface to TRANSSCRIPT

   SYNOPSIS
     ppanel [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ -f_f_i_l_t_e_r ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_p_a_n_e_l provides a graphical user interface to all the TRANSSCRIPT pro-
     grams.  It allows you to translate, manipulate, and print files, as well
     as save the output to another file, take advantage of POSTSCRIPT
     printers with fax capabilities, or preview documents if you have an
     appropriate POSTSCRIPT language document previewer.

     The possible options are:

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          the print panel comes up with _p_r_i_n_t_e_r selected from the list of
          printers.  The default selection is the value of the PRINTER
          environment variable.

     -f_f_i_l_t_e_r
          selects _f_i_l_t_e_r from the list of filters.  The default is the value
          of the TSFILTER environment variable, if set; if this variable
          isn't set, the default filter is "none".
