   NAME
     POSTSCRIPT language-page description language

   DESCRIPTION
     The POSTSCRIPT page description language is a programming language with
     powerful graphics primitives for describing printed pages.  A growing
     number of devices that print or display POSTSCRIPT language documents
     are available.  POSTSCRIPT printers are available from a wide variety of
     printer manufacturers.  The TRANSCRIPT package of UNIX software allows
     UNIX systems access to POSTSCRIPT printers.

     The complete POSTSCRIPT language is described in the book:
