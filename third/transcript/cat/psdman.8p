   NAME
     psdman-TRANSCRIPT document manager for POSTSCRIPT printers

   SYNOPSIS
     psdman [ -rfsGFaL ] [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e ] [ -p_p_r_o_g ] [ -n_u_s_e_r ] [ -h_h_o_s_t ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_d_m_a_n is the TRANSCRIPT document manager invoked by the printer inter-
     face script psinterface (System V) or psint.sh (BSD) after the printer
     interface program has been invoked by the print spooler.

     _p_s_d_m_a_n is responsible for reading the the document file to be printed,
     and taking the appropriate action to prepare the file for printing on a
     POSTSCRIPT printer.  _p_s_d_m_a_n distinguishes between text files (which get
     formatted) and POSTSCRIPT language files.  If the input to _p_s_d_m_a_n does
     not begin with the POSTSCRIPT language magic number-the first two char-
     acters being "%!"- _p_s_d_m_a_n will invoke enscript to create a listing of
     the file.  If the first bytes of the input file are "%!PS-Adobe-", and
     if the printer options so specify, _p_s_d_m_a_n will also will perform various
     document management tasks, such as page reversal, font and other
     resource downloading, and printer-specific feature inclusion (manual
     feed, duplex, paper tray setting, etc.) before printing, if so
     requested.  _p_s_d_m_a_n supports LZW compression and ASCII85 encodingfor
     Level 2 printers.

     The possible options are:

     -r   never reverse.

     -f   continues processing despite errors.  This is the default.

     -s   stops when errors are encountered.

     -G   do not attempt to rearrange fonts for more efficient downloading.

     -F   turns off parsing.  If this is specified, _p_s_d_m_a_n will simply pass
          the data through without attempting to perform any document manage-
          ment.  Conversion of text files will still occur.

     -a   strips out comments.  If this is specified, psdman will strip out
          any line that begins with "%".

     -L   landscape. _P_s_d_m_a_n will cause the input to be printed rotated 90
          degrees.  It will not attempt to make sure the resulting image will
          fit on the page.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e
          _p_r_i_n_t_e_r_n_a_m_e is the name of the POSTSCRIPT printer for which output
          is intended.

     -p_p_r_o_g_r_a_m
          _p_r_o_g_r_a_m (BSD only) is the name of the program through which psdman
          was invoked.  Typically this is psif.

     -h_h_o_s_t
          _h_o_s_t (BSD only) is the name of the host from which the print job
          originated.

     -n_u_s_e_r
          _u_s_e_r (BSD only) is the name of the user for whom the print job is
          being printed.

   ENVIRONMENT
     There are a number of environment variables used by _p_s_d_m_a_n which are
     listed below.  The psinterface (System V) or psint.sh (BSD) script sets
     the initial value for each, and the printer options file can be used to
     change the value for a particular printer.  Note that Bourne shell syn-
     tax must be used in the printer options file.  For BSD, this file is in
     the spool directory; for System V, look in
     /usr/spool/lp/transcript/ps.opt.  Many of the variables take a numerical
     value, and specify whether an action should take place or not; 1 means
     do the action and 0 means don't do it.

     REVERSE=_n_u_m_b_e_r
          reverse the page order

     VERBOSELOG=_n_u_m_b_e_r
          print verbose log messages

     COMPRESS=_n_u_m_b_e_r
          perform LZW compression on the file

     PSTEMPDIR=_D_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y _n_a_m_e
          directory for temporary files

     You could turn off page reversal for a particular printer by adding this
     line to the printer options file:
         REVERSE=0     export REVERSE

   FILES

     XPSLIBDIRX/bogusmsg.ps
                           POSTSCRIPT language file for a "spooled binary
                           file rejected" message to printer

     XPSTEMPDIRX/t*        Temporary file to format text files.
