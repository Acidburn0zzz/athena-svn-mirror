   NAME
     AFM-Adobe font metrics file format

   DESCRIPTION
     AFM files are a standard interchange format for communicating Type 1
     font metric information to people and programs.  The format is ASCII
     encoded (for both human and machine readability), machine independent,
     extensible, simple to parse, and simple to generate.  AFM files are
     available for all of Adobe Systems' POSTSCRIPT font programs.

     While somewhat verbose, the format is intended to be easily parsed, with
     the ability for applications to quickly skip over items that are not of
     interest.  It should be possible to create simple line-oriented parsing
     programs, or tools based on awk(1) or sed(1).

     Each AFM file contains the information for only one font face.  The file
     begins with global information about the font, followed by sections with
     character metrics.  The file format is line-oriented, each line begin-
     ning with a property (key) name, followed by the values for that pro-
     perty.  The general idea is to give key-value tuples.

     The format is:
          Key [value value ...]
     Key names are case-sensitive.  All keys beginning with a capital letter
     are reserved by Adobe Systems.  The standard keys are detailed below,
     but other keys should be allowed and safely ignored by programs not
     recognizing them.  All standard keys begin with a capital letter.
     User-defined nonstandard entries should begin with a lowercase letter.

     The file begins with the line:
          StartFontMetrics _v_e_r_s_i_o_n
     The version described here is 1.0.  The last line of the file is:
          EndFontMetrics

     The following global font keys are defined.  Many of them are defined as
     in the top level or FontInfo subdictionary of a POSTSCRIPT font diction-
     ary.  All numeric values are in the (1000 unit per em) character coordi-
     nate system.

     FontName _s_t_r_i_n_g
                    the name of the font as presented to the findfont opera-
                    tor.

     FullName _s_t_r_i_n_g
                    the "print name" of the font.

     FamilyName _s_t_r_i_n_g
                    the font family name.

     Weight _s_t_r_i_n_g  the weight of the font.

     ItalicAngle _r_e_a_l
                    the angle (in degrees counter-clockwise from the verti-
                    cal) of the dominant staffs of the font.

     IsFixedPitch _b_o_o_l_e_a_n
                    indicates monospaced (typewriter) fonts.

     FontBBox _l_l_x _l_l_y _u_r_x _u_r_y
                    four integers giving the lower left corner and the upper
                    right corner of the font bounding box.  Note: the bound-
                    ing box given here is that of the flattened paths, not of
                    the Bezier curve descriptions.

     UnderlinePosition _n_u_m_b_e_r
                    the position (from the baseline) to place an underline.

     UnderlineThickness _n_u_m_b_e_r
                    thickness of an underline stroke.

     Version _s_t_r_i_n_g font version identifier.

     Notice _s_t_r_i_n_g  font name trademark or copyright notice.

     Comment _s_t_r_i_n_g comment strings may be ignored.

     EncodingScheme _s_t_r_i_n_g
                    a string indicating the default encoding vector for this
                    font.  The most common one is AdobeStandardEncoding.
                    Special fonts may simply state "FontSpecific".  In the
                    future, other schemes may be employed.

     CapHeight _n_u_m_b_e_r
                    top of capital H.

     XHeight _n_u_m_b_e_r top of lower case x.

     Ascender _n_u_m_b_e_r
                    top of lower case d.

     Descender _n_u_m_b_e_r
                    bottom of lower case p.

     The individual character metrics are surrounded with the lines
     StartCharMetrics and EndCharMetrics and consist of a list of keys and
     values separated by semicolons.  The characters are sorted (numeric
     ascending) by character code.  Unencoded characters follow all the
     encoded ones and are distinguished by having character code -1.  Each
     character gets one line of description. Standard keys are:

     C _n_u_m_b_e_r       decimal value of default character code (-1 if unen-
                    coded).

     WX _w_i_d_t_h-_x     character width in _x (y is 0).

     W _w_i_d_t_h-_x _w_i_d_t_h-_y
                    character width vector.

     N _n_a_m_e         character name.

     B _l_l_x _l_l_y _u_r_x _u_r_y
                    the character bounding box.

     L _s_u_c_c_e_s_s_o_r _l_i_g_a_t_u_r_e
                    a ligature sequence;  The current character may join with
                    the character named _s_u_c_c_e_s_s_o_r to form the character named
                    _l_i_g_a_t_u_r_e.  Note that characters may have more than one
                    such entry.

     Most western language fonts have WX rather than W entries.  Note that
     keys are one letter for brevity.  Here, too, the set is extensible, with
     unknown entries ignored.  (This leaves room for the addition of new
     information, for example.) A future revision of this format will have a
     specification for kerning information.
