   NAME
     lpcomm-TRANSCRIPT Centronix parallel communications filter for x86 hosts

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/lpcomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT Centronix parallel communication filter
     for use by the System V or BSD line printer spooling system on an x86
     host. It is called from the printer interface script for the printer.
     The program _l_p_c_o_m_m is the lowest level filter.  It manages communication
     with the printer; since the parallel interface is one-directional, no
     status, error, or accounting reporting is supported.  _l_p_c_o_m_m will write
     a log of each job processed in the log file.
