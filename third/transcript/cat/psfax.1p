   NAME
     psfax-send faxes to POSTSCRIPT fax printers

   SYNOPSIS
     psfax [ -lct ] [ -k_k_e_y ] [ -f_d_b_f_i_l_e ] [ -d_f_a_x_n_u_m_b_e_r ] [ -S_o_p_t=_v_a_l_u_e ] [
     -n_r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t_n_a_m_e ] [ -p_o_u_t ]
     [ -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_f_a_x reads in POSTSCRIPT language documents and inserts the appropriate
     POSTSCRIPT language to allow those files to be sent as faxes by a
     POSTSCRIPT fax printer.  Details about the fax such as recipient, phone
     number, sender, etc, may be specified on the command line or by looking
     in a phone book.

     For example:
          psfax -Paleph -dT9,5551234 -n"John Smith" memo.ps
     will cause memo.ps to be imaged, converted into fax format, and faxed to
     555-1234, with John Smith's name on the cover sheet as the recipient.
          psfax -Paleph -kjsmith -t picture.ps
     will look up the entry for jsmith in the phone book and instruct the
     printer to send picture.ps as a POSTSCRIPT language document, rather
     than imaging and sending it as a fax, to the POSTSCRIPT fax printer
     aleph.

     _P_s_f_a_x supports an address book mechanism.  The format of the file con-
     sists of a key on a line, followed by a set of lines of the form
     "option=value".  The entry for a key is terminated by a single "." on a
     line.  Multiple values for the key are allowed, separated by "|".  You
     can specify a key "always" for information, such as your name,  you wish
     to have included in every fax.  Comments are indicated by lines begin-
     ning with '%'.  Entries of the form "option:value" indicate that,
     instead of assigning the string "value" to the option, "value" indicates
     a file name, and the contents of the file should be assigned to the
     option.  This is most often used for specifying POSTSCRIPT language pro-
     cedures for items such as coversheets.

     You can also set up an entry that is a list of other entries.  Lines
     that begin with "/list=", followed by a list of keys in the database,
     allow you to send the same fax to a list of people.  You can specify
     "option=value" or "option:value" pairs in the list entry, and those
     pairs will hold for all the faxes and override any matching entry in the
     individual entry for a given key in the list.

     A sample address book file looks like this:

     % Sample address book
     always
     SenderName=Joe Smith
     SenderOrg=High Tech Software, Inc.

     The environment variable PSFAXDB may be used to specify the location of
     the address book file, or it may be specified from the command line.
     The default location for the file is in $HOME/.faxdb.

     The possible options for _p_s_f_a_x are:

     -k_k_e_y
          specifies the key to look up in the address book.

     -f_d_b_f_i_l_e
          specifies the location of the address book file.  Default is
          $HOME/.faxdb.

     -d_f_a_x_n_u_m
          specifies the fax number of the recipient.  This must be in the
          form a fax modem can handle.  This option is useful when sending a
          fax to someone not in your address book, or when sending to someone
          in your address book but at a different fax number.  The fax number
          must be specified somewhere, either with this switch or in the
          database.

     -t   if specified, sends the fax as a POSTSCRIPT language document,
          rather than as rasterized fax.

     -c   don't use the address book.

     -n_n_a_m_e
          specifies the RecipientName to be _n_a_m_e from the command line.

     -P_p_r_i_n_t_e_r
          specifies the printer for spooling.

     -p_o_u_t_f_i_l_e
          specifies the file for saving output.

     -S_o_p_t_i_o_n=_v_a_l_u_e
