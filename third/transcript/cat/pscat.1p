   NAME
     pscat-convert C/A/T files to POSTSCRIPT language format

   SYNOPSIS
     pscat [ -F_f_o_n_t_t_a_b_l_e ] [ -i_p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e_f_i_l_e ] [ -l_p_a_p_e_r_l_e_n_g_t_h ] [ -x_x_o_f_f_s_e_t ]
     [ -y_y_o_f_f_s_e_t ] [ _f_i_l_e ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_c_a_t converts C/A/T format _f_i_l_e (i.e., as produced by the original
     [o]troff (1)), to POSTSCRIPT language format on the standard output.  If
     no _f_i_l_e argument is given, the standard input is used.  The average user
     will probably be happy using ptroff (1), but explicit use of _p_s_c_a_t gives
     more control.

     Page offset distances and the page length are specified by giving a
     fixed-point real number optionally followed by a units measure.  For
     example, 1in means one inch, 15mm means fifteen millimeters.  If no
     units are indicated, points (72 to the inch) are used.  The options are:

     -F_f_o_n_t_t_a_b_l_e
          specifies a font correspondence table for use by the converter.
          (The default is usually Times.ct where the mounted fonts are:
          R=Times-Roman, I=Times-Italic, B=Times-Bold, and S=Symbol.  Note
          that troff should be invoked with an appropriate -F switch and
          explicit ".fp" commands.)

     -i_p_r_o_l_o_g_u_e_f_i_l_e
          specifies a file to be incorporated as the POSTSCRIPT language pro-
          logue, otherwise the default prologue will be used (see below).

     -l_p_a_g_e_l_e_n_g_t_h
          specifies the page length to use when splitting the C/A/T file into
          pages.  The default is 11 inches.  Units are described above.

     -x_x_o_f_f_s_e_t
          moves the output _x_o_f_f_s_e_t to the right on the paper.  The default is
          0.  Units are described above.

     -y_y_o_f_f_s_e_t
          moves the output _y_o_f_f_s_e_t downward on the paper.  The default is 0.
          Different versions of troff have different notions of where the top
          edge of the paper really is, so careful setting of the -y switch
          may be necessary.  Units are described above.

   ENVIRONMENT

     PSLIBDIR
          path name of a directory to use instead of XPSLIBDIRX for _p_s_c_a_t
          prologue and font metric files

   FILES

     XTROFFFONTDIRX/*.ct   character correspondence tables (built by pscatmap
                           (8)) mapping C/A/T codes to POSTSCRIPT language
                           fonts and characters or other actions

     XPSLIBDIRX/pscat.pro  default POSTSCRIPT language prologue

   BUGS
     Because of the character mapping tables used, arbitrary use of the ".fp"
     troff directive will usually produce the wrong results.  The family.head
     files that ptroff feeds to troff contain ".fp" commands appropriate for
     a given font family.  Users must build and reference correct tables with
     pscatmap (8) for non-standard ".fp" combinations to work.

     The mapping from the default troff fonts to Adobe's Times-Roman will not
     look good.  POSTSCRIPT language font width tables (and ".fp" commands)
     should be used explicitly in troff.

     _p_s_c_a_t determines where page breaks occur by assuming that each page is
     exactly the specified length.  There is no indication of page boundaries
     in the C/A/T file, so improper use of the -l option will lead to
     undesirable results.  Some troff macro packages generate cutmarks at
     logical edges of the page which may or may not get imaged on a
     POSTSCRIPT printer.  Careful use of the -x and -y options may help.
