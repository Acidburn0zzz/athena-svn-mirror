   NAME
     ps4014-convert a Tektronix 4014 files to POSTSCRIPT language format

   SYNOPSIS
     ps4014 [ -RCNm ] [ -p_o_u_t_f_i_l_e ] [ -l_l_e_f_t,_b_o_t_t_o_m ] [ -s_w_i_d_t_h,_h_e_i_g_h_t ] [ -
     S_w_i_d_t_h ] [ _f_i_l_e ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_4_0_1_4 reads in a Tektronix 4014-format file and converts it to
     POSTSCRIPT language format for printing on a POSTSCRIPT printer.  If no
     _f_i_l_e is specified, the standard input is used.  The resulting POSTSCRIPT
     language file may be directed to the standard output or to a named file.

     The possible options are:

     -p_o_u_t_f_i_l_e
          causes the POSTSCRIPT language file to be written to the named file
          rather than the standard output.

     The following parameters affect the size, placement, and orientation of
     the image on the printed page.  By default, the 4014 image is scaled to
     occupy nearly the whole page in a landscape orientation.

     -l_l_e_f_t,_b_o_t_t_o_m
          specifies the location on the printed page of the bottom left
          corner of the converted raster image.  The values _l_e_f_t and _b_o_t_t_o_m
          are the distances (in inches) from the bottom left corner of the
          printed page to the bottom left corner of the image.

     -s_w_i_d_t_h,_h_e_i_g_h_t
          specifies the size of the converted raster image on the printed
          page.  _W_i_d_t_h and _h_e_i_g_h_t are the dimensions (in inches) of the
          resulting image on the printed page.

     -S_w_i_d_t_h
          allows you to scale the image without distorting its shape. _W_i_d_t_h
          specifies the width (in inches) of the resulting image on the
          printed page.  The height of the image is computed to maintain the
          same ratio of height to width on the output image as on the input
          raster-format file.

     -R   rotates the image 90 degrees on the page for portrait orientation.
          The default is landscape orientation.

     The following parameters specify values for 4014 hardware options that
     affect the interpretation of 4014 commands.

     -C   causes a carriage return to move the pen position to the left mar-
          gin but not down to the next line.  By default, a carriage return
          command moves the pen down to the next line and over to the left

          margin.

     -N   causes line feed to move the pen position down to the next line but
          not to the left margin. By default, a line feed command moves the
          pen down to the next line and over to the left margin.

     -m   enables the "Margin 2" mode for the 4014.
