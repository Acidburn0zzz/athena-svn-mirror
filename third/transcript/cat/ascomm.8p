   NAME
     ascomm-TRANSCRIPT AppSocket TCP/IP communication filter for POSTSCRIPT
     printers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/ascomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT AppSocket TCP/IP communication filter
     for use by the 4.2BSD line printer spooling system through the printer
     description file /etc/printcap, or by the System V spooling system.  For
     4.2BSD, it is called from the _p_s_i_n_t._s_h shell script.  This script uses
     argv[0] (the name it was invoked under) to determine which action to
     take, which may involve invoking a translation filter or management
     filter before invoking the communications filter. The options are as
     specified in the _4._2_B_S_D _L_i_n_e _P_r_i_n_t_e_r _S_p_o_o_l_e_r _M_a_n_u_a_l. If a log file is
     specified in /etc/printcap, will maintain a log of each job processed,
     as well as any error output from the printer.  For System V, it is
     called from the _p_s_i_n_t_e_r_f_a_c_e shell script.  The program _a_s_c_o_m_m is the
     lowest level filter.  It manages communication with the printer, error
     handling, status reporting, etc.  It also manages a printer log file
     named transcript/_p_r_i_n_t_e_r-log (under the lp spooling directory).

   ENVIRONMENT

     VERBOSELOG=_n_u_m_b_e_r
          print verbose log messages

     ASCONTROL=_n_u_m_b_e_r
          if 1, use AppSocket control protocol (default)

     ASSTATUS=_n_u_m_b_e_r
          if 1, query status during job on status port (default)

   FILES

     _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.acct          printer accounting file  (4.2BSD)

     _p_r_i_n_t_e_r-log           printer log file

     status                printer status file (in the spool directory),
                           shared by _l_p_d(_8) and _a_s_c_o_m_m (4.2BSD)

     To use ascomm to communicate with HP printers via TCP/IP, set both
     ASCONTROL and ASSTATUS to 0 (in the .options or _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.opt files.)
