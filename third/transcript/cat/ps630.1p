   NAME
     ps630-convert Diablo 630 print files to POSTSCRIPT language format

   SYNOPSIS
     ps630 [ -f_b_o_d_y_f_o_n_t ] [ -F_b_o_l_d_f_o_n_t ] [ -s_p_i_t_c_h ] [ -p_f_i_l_e ] [ _f_i_l_e_s ]

   DESCRIPTION
     _p_s_6_3_0 reads in _f_i_l_e_s (Diablo 630-format print files) and converts them
     to POSTSCRIPT language format for printing on a POSTSCRIPT printer.  If
     no _f_i_l_e_s are specified, the standard input is used.  By default, the
     POSTSCRIPT language program is sent to the standard output.  _p_s_6_3_0 can
     convert nroff files generated with the -Txerox switch.  Typewheel emula-
     tion information may be specified as options.  Font specifications (for
     bold and regular) are POSTSCRIPT font names (e.g., Times-Roman, Times-
     Bold, Courier-Bold, Courier-BoldOblique).  10, 12, or 15 characters per
     inch may be selected.

     The possible options are:

     -f_b_o_d_y_f_o_n_t
          sets the font to be used for normal printing.  The default is
          Courier.

     -F_b_o_l_d_f_o_n_t
          sets the font to be used for boldface.  The default is Courier-
          Bold.

     -s_p_i_t_c_h
          selects type size for printing (both the regular and bold fonts are
          scaled to this size).  _P_i_t_c_h is in characters per inch and must be
          10, 12, or 15.  The default is 12.

     -p_f_i_l_e
          causes the POSTSCRIPT language document to be written to the named
          file rather than the standard output.

   ENVIRONMENT

     PSLIBDIR
          path name of a directory to use instead of XPSLIBDIRX for the _p_s_6_3_0
          prologue

   BUGS
     Some applications produce "bold" by double striking a character.  This
     will not appear as bold when translated into the POSTSCRIPT language.
     Only the bold produced by issuing the proper Diablo command sequence
     (escape-O) will result in bold characters.

     The output of _p_s_6_3_0 cannot be page-reversed.

     Times-Roman and Helvetica are narrow fonts that may look squeezed if no
     adjustment of page width is made by the application.

     The following Diablo 630 commands are not supported: print suppression,
     HY-Plot, extended character set, downloading print wheel information or
     program mode, page lengths other than 11 inches, paper feeder control,
     hammer energy control, remote diagnostic, backward printing control
     (note, however, that "reverse printing" is supported).
