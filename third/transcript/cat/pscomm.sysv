   NAME
     pscomm -TRANSCRIPT serial communications filter for POSTSCRIPT printers

   SYNOPSIS
     XPSLIBDIRX/pscomm

   DESCRIPTION
     This is the low-level TRANSCRIPT serial communication filter for use by
     the System V line printer spooling system.  It is called from the _p_s_i_n_-
     _t_e_r_f_a_c_e shell script.  The program _p_s_c_o_m_m is the lowest level filter.
     It manages communication with the printer, error handling, status
     reporting, etc. Psinterface and _p_s_c_o_m_m manage a printer log file named
     transcript/_p_r_i_n_t_e_r-log (under the lp spooling directory).  This file
     contains a log of each job processed, as well as any error output from
     the printer.  In particular, it contains messages regarding the printer
     being out of paper, jammed, etc.  Doing a tail on this file will help
     determine the printer's status.
