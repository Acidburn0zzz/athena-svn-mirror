#
# This is a shell script that get's "sourced" when building and
# installing TranScript software.  It sets up definitions of the
# places that TranScript wants to do it's work.
# This script is concerned with the software itself, not with
# the printers.  Another script (printer.bsd or printer.sysv) is used
# to configure printers.
#
# If you change the values in this script, parts of the TranScript
# system may need to be remade (recompiled), and reinstalled.
#

# LINKS - TRUE if your system supports symbolic links, FALSE otherwise.
LINKS=TRUE

# LP - the pathname for the spooling program on your system (usually either
# lpr or lp.
LP=/usr/bin/lp

# XPG3 - TRUE if your system is XPG3 compliant, FALSE otherwise.  If you
# don't if your system is XPG3 compliant, some things to look for are the
# existence of /usr/include/stdlib.h, /usr/include/dirent.h and the tempnam
# function.  If your system is missing any of those, set XPG3 to FALSE.

XPG3=TRUE

# SYS - one of SYSV or BSD.  Mostly refers to the spooler and spooling
# daemon.  If your system uses lpr/lpd, you want BSD; if your system uses
# lp/lpsched, use SYSV.   
OPSYS=SYSV

# SOLARIS - TRUE if you have Solaris 2.0 or greater, FALSE otherwise.
# Solaris is mostly SYSV, but there are some differences in the adminstration
# of the spooling system.
SOLARIS=TRUE

# CCOMP - path for C compiler.
CCOMP=/opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc

# 
# BUILDDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript will do the compilations and
#	other work necessary to build a TranScript release.  This allows
#	a convenient mechanism for cleaning up, and for maintaining
#	multiple builds of TranScript for different machine types.
BUILDDIR=/user/transcript/solaris

# SRCDIR
#	This is the directory where the source programs for building
#	TranScript are stored.  Buildprograms.sh (and the other building
#	shell scriptswill link (or copy) files from this directory into
#	BUILDDIR in order to build the release.  This directory is
#	typically the directory into which you untarred the tape.
SRCDIR=/usr/local/src/transcript

# BINDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript user programs are put.
#	It should be in the PATH of each user that want's to use them.
#	Many UNIX sites will keep these kinds of programs separate
#	from the regular UNIX utilites but in a well-known spot, like
#	"/usr/local/bin", "/usr/local", etc.  Whatever you choose,
#	make sure it's in people's search paths.  The TranScript
#	installation sequence will write in this directory.
BINDIR=/usr/local/bin

# PSLIBDIR
#	This is a directory where TranScript keeps lots of things:.
#	spooler interface filters, font metrics files, prologue files,
#	and executables needed by TranScript or administrators, but not
#	by general users.
PSLIBDIR=/usr/local/lib/ts

# DEFRESPATH
# 	The default path to look for fonts and other resources.  DEFRESPATH
# 	should consist of a colon-separated list of directories.  If you only
# 	have one directory containing resources, no colon is necessary.
#	The defaults can be overridden by the PSRESOURCEPATH environment
#	variable.  PSRESOURCEPATH can include the default path by placing
#	two consecutive colons ("::") in the path.
#	 
#	Each directory in the path should contain at least one file with a
#	.upr extension.  These files are used for locating resources; they
#	contain mappings from resource name to file name.  As part of the
#	installation process, afmfiles.upr will be installed along with the
#	afm files provided in the release into the /usr/psres directory, so
#	$PSLIBDIR should be part of this path.  A fuller explanation of the
#	format of a .upr file can be found in the upr man page.
DEFRESPATH=/usr/psres

# PPDDIR
#	The location of PPD (PostScript Printer Description) files.
#
PPDDIR=$PSLIBDIR/ppd

# OWNER GROUP
#	User and group names for installed files
#	On BSD systems, this is typically "root" and "staff"
#
OWNER=root
GROUP=staff

# PSTEMPDIR
#	The temporary directory you want TranScript filters to use
#	when necessary.  Sometimes this may need to hold a large print
#	file, so choose a tmp directory on a filesystem with enough
#	space.
PSTEMPDIR=/usr/tmp

# NROFF
#	Some versions of Unix do not come with nroff.  If you do not have
#	nroff, or would prefer to have already nroff'ed man pages
#	installed, set NROFF to TRUE.  Note: most versions of Unix put
#	pre-formatted man pages in the cat? directories rather than the man?
#	directories. 
NROFF=FALSE

# EXTCOM, EXTFILES, EXTSYS
# 	The extensions for man pages; EXTCOM is for man pages for user
#	commands, EXTFILES for man pages describing file formats, and
# 	EXTSYS for system commands.  In BSD, these would be 1, 7, and 8,
#	respectively.  Other versions of Unix use C, F, and ADM.  
EXTCOM=1
EXTFILES=7
EXTSYS=1m

# MANCOM MANFILES MANSYS
#	The place you want the on-line manual pages installed.
#	If you want them all in the same place, 
#	(e.g., /usr/man/manl), set them all to that.
#       Pre-formatted man pages are usually installed in cat? directories.
MANCOM=/usr/man/man1
MANFILES=/usr/man/man7
MANSYS=/usr/man/man1m

# DITDIR
#	This directory will contain the font family directories that
#	are used by "psroff" and "psdit".
#	DON'T make it /usr/lib/font/devpsc!
DITDIR=$PSLIBDIR/ditroff.font

# DITDEFAULT - the default font family. $DITDIR/$DITDEFAULT/devpsc will
# contain the default font info.
DITDEFAULT=Times

# MAKEDEV 
#	is the FULL pathname of the makedev program for ditroff
#	(for Berkeley ditroff, this file is called "devconfig")
#	You may have to go hunting to find it (maybe even recompile it)
#	If you do not have ditroff (i.e., don't have makedev), set 
#	DITROFFFONTS=0 (see below).
MAKEDEV=/usr/bin/makedev

# TROFFFONTDIR
#	This directory will contain the font family directories that
#	are used by "ptroff" and "pscat".
#	DON'T make it /usr/lib/font if you can help it!
TROFFFONTDIR=$PSLIBDIR/troff.font

# TROFFDEFAULT - default font family.  $TROFFFONTDIR/$TROFFDEFUALT  will
# contain the default font info. 
TROFFDEFAULT=Times


# BANNERFIRST BANNERLAST
#	These determine the default actions to take with job banner pages.
#	These pages (printed by the spooler to identify a job) may
#	be printed either before the job itself, after the job, or both,
#	or neither.  Note that this is the site-wide default.
#	These values can be overridden for specific printers using the
#	.options file in the spool directory (see documentation).
#	Limitations in the spooler make it difficult to print a trailing
#	banner correctly. Therefore BANNERLAST may have the following values:
#	  0: Do not print a trailing banner.
#	  1: Print a trailing banner after EACH copy when multiple copies
#	     are specified.  WARNING: This will print the banner from the
#	     previous job when a lpr -h (no header) job is printed.
#	  2: Print trailing banners, except for lpr -h jobs.  WARNING: 
#	     The trailing banner is printed only after the FIRST copy when
#	     multiple copies are requested.
BANNERFIRST=0
BANNERLAST=1

# REVERSE
#	This indicates whether the default action on a user job is to
#	reverse the page order in a user job.  It is used with printers
#	that pile pages "face up".  To specify that no reversal should be
#	done, use REVERSE= line instead.  Note that this is the site-wide
#	default.  This value can be overridden for specific printers using the
#	.options file in the spool directory (see documentation).
#	If this value is set, you will probably want banners to be
#	printer AFTER the job is printed (BANNERLAST).
#REVERSE=1
REVERSE=

# VERBOSELOG
#	Indicates that verbose job logging should take place in the 
#	printer log files.  It can be reset on a per-printer basis,
#	so don't worry about it here.
VERBOSELOG=1

# SETCFLAGS
#	Lists the flags that are to be passed to the "C" compiler (cc)
#	whenever a program is compiled.  Other flags (such as for type 
#       of operating system, etc. will get added automatically by the
#       buildprogs.sh script.  On some systems with ANSI C compilers, there
#	may be an assumption that function prototypes should be used, yet
#	not all the libraries used in building the TranScript programs may
#	support function prototypes.  On such systems (Suns and Sparcs
#	using the MIT X code fall into this category), you may need to add
#	"-D_NO_PROTO" to SETCFLAGS to build the print panel.
SETCFLAGS="-O"

# BUILDPRINTPANEL
#	If this is set to TRUE, a Motif-based print panel will be built
#	that serves as a GUI to the TranScript programs.  If you don't have
#	the Motif libraries, this won't compile, so you want to set
#	BUILDPRINTPANEL to FALSE.  The print panel also requires that you
#	have X11R4 or later.
BUILDPRINTPANEL=TRUE

# XLIBS
#	This is only relevant if BUILDPRINTPANEL is TRUE.  XLIBS should be
#	set to pass the linker where to find the X, Xt,  and Motif
#	libraries. This should be in the form of linker flags, as in 
#	"-L/usr/local/X11/lib -L/usr/local/motif/lib".  You may not need
#	more than one -L value, if the Motif libraries are in the same
#	place as the X libraries.
#	For Solaris, use -R and a colon separated list of the directories
#	in addition to -L, so that users don't have to have their
#	LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to run the program.
XLIBS="-L/usr/openwin/lib -L/opt/SUNWmotif/lib \
-R/usr/openwin/lib:/opt/SUNWmotif/lib"

# XINCLS
#	Similar to XLIBS, but for include files.  This should be in the
#	form of C flags, as in
#	"-I/usr/local/X11/include -I/usr/local/motif/include". 
XINCLS="-I/usr/openwin/include -I/opt/SUNWmotif/include"

# SPECIALLIBS
#	On some machines, extra libraries may be need to compile X
#	applications, beyond the normal -lXm -lXt -lX11.  SGI is an example
# 	of this: -lPW is necessary to pull in some routines used by some
#	Motif widgets.  If no special libraries are needed to compile the
#	print panel, this should be empty.  On the SGI, this should be
#	"-lPW".  On Solaris, this should be "-lgen".
SPECIALLIBS="-lgen"

#XRES
#	XRES is the name of the directory you want the resource file for
# 	the print panel placed in.  
XRES=/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults

#PREVIEWLOC
#	PREVIEWLOC is the path name of a PostScript previewer, such as
#	the ShowPage previewer from Adobe, if you have one.  Any X-based
# 	PostScript previewer that can accept input from a pipe will work
#	with ppanel.  This will be the default; it can be overridden with
#	the PREVIEWER environment variable.  If it is null, ppanel will
#	come up with the preview option grayed out, and not selectable.
PREVIEWLOC=/usr/local/bin/showps

# QMS
#	If this is set to TRUE, qmscomm, a module for communicating over
#	Ethernet to QMS Ethernet printers, will be built.
QMS=FALSE

# APPSOCKET
#	If this is set to TRUE, ascomm, a program for communicating over
#	TCP/IP to printers supporting the AppSocket protocol, will be
#	built. 
APPSOCKET=TRUE

#SOCKFLAGS
#	This is only relevant for SYSV machines.  Some of the TCP/IP based
#	comm programs use BSD-style sockets.  SOCKFLAGS contain the
#	libraries that should be linked in when compiling these programs.
#	On SCO Unix, these are "-lsocket -lnsl_s"; on AIX, these are
# 	"-ltli".  For Solaris, use "-lsocket -lnsl".   Some SYSV machines
#	may have incorporated BSD style sockets; for those machines (like
#	the SGI), this variable should be "", and you should set
#	BSDSOCK to true. 

SOCKFLAGS="-lsocket -lnsl_s"

#BSDSOCK
#	This should be TRUE for all BSD-style machines, and should be TRUE
#	for any SYSV machine that has BSD-style sockets built in, like the
#	SGI.  It is FALSE for SYSV machines that need to have libraries
#	linked in for sockets.

BSDSOCK=FALSE

# PARALLEL
#  	If this is true, build lpcomm, a communications module for
#	communicating with printer via Centronics parallel port.  This is
#	supported on x86 machines.
PARALLEL=FALSE

# FASTPORT
# 	If this is true, build fpcomm, a communications module for
#	communicating with printers via MiLAN Technology's FastPort print
#	server.  
FASTPORT=FALSE

# SCOFASTPORT
# 	If you want to build fpcomm for an SCO machine, set both FASTPORT
#	and this variable to true; a slightly different version of fpcomm
#	is needed for SCO Unix.
SCOFASTPORT=FALSE

# SCOSERIAL
#	If you want to talk to a printer over a serial port via the
#	FastPort box from an SCO machine (in addition to the parallel
#	port), set SCOSERIAl to TRUE, and fpcomm.ser will be built and
#	installed.  (Don't forget to then specify fpcomm.ser to the
#	mkprinter.sh script for the printer you want to communicate with in
#	this fashion.
SCOSERIAL=FALSE


# UDPSTATUS
#	If your FastPort supports supplying UDP status (version 2.0
#	firmware or later), set this to TRUE.
UDPSTATUS=TRUE

# RESOLVLIB
#	On some systems (Suns and Sparcs, for example), if you wish to have
#	fpcomm use BIND to resolve hostnames, you must link in the
#	resolver library.  For Suns and Sparcs, this is "-lresolv".  On
#	other systems, such as Decstations, no extra library is necessary,
#	and this should be blank.  If you don't wish to have BIND resolve
#	hostnames, then this should be left blank.
RESOLVLIB="-lresolv"

# CAP
#	This controls whether or not capcomm, a program for communicating 
#	with printers on Appletalk, gets built.  You must have the CAP
#	libraries available on your system to build capcomm.  This has only
#	been tested for BSD systems, and may not work on SYSV systems.
CAP=FALSE

# CAPLIB
#	This is only relevant if CAP is set to TRUE.  CAPLIB should be set
#	to tell the linker where to find the CAP libraries.  This should be
# 	in the form of linker flags, as in "-L/usr/local/lib.
CAPLIB=-L/usr/local/lib

# CAPINCL
#	Similar to CAPLIB, but for include files.
CAPINCL=-I/usr/local

# ALTENCODING
#	If you'd like to use font encodings other than the standard one
# 	with enscript (such as ISOLatin), set this to TRUE.
ALTENCODING=FALSE


# TROFFASCIIFONTS - this if for Ultrix on the DecStation, which requires
# that the troff font width files be in ascii rather than the usual format.
# This is only known to affect Decstations and possibly MIPS machines
# running the MIPS operating system.

TROFFASCIIFONTS=FALSE

# FONTFAMILIES
#	List of the troff/ditroff font families to install.  This sets
#	up the fonts that will be available in troff/ditroff.  Any font
#	that is NOT in this list will not be available AT ALL, barring
#	difficult manual intervention later.  The default is set up for
#	the standard 13 fonts: the Times, Helvetica, and Courier families,
#	and the Symbol font.  Other font families may be added.  Each font
#	FAMILY takes about 35 KB of disk space for ditroff, and 20 KB for
#	troff.  You may wish to check the documentation for the PostScript
#	printer(s) at your site to determine which fonts to install.
#	If all font are installed, about 450 KB of disk space is used.
#	NOTE: Make sure that ALL values of FONTFAMILIES are commented out
#	except one.
#	Examples of recognized font family names are:
#	AvantGarde  Bookman    Courier   Garamond   Helvetica  HelvNarrow
#	Lubalin     NewCentury Optima    Palatino   Souvenir   Times
#	HelvNarrow = Helvetica-Narrow
#	NewCentury = NewCenturySchlbk
#	Zapf      = ZapfChancery-MediumItalic
#	The families in most PostScript printers:
STANDARD13="Times Helvetica Courier"
STANDARD35="$STANDARD13 AvantGarde Bookman HelvNarrow NewCentury Palatino Zapf"
FONTFAMILIES=$STANDARD13
# FONTFAMILIES=$STANDARD35
#	All the font families that were shipped:
# FONTFAMILIES="$STANDARD35 Garamond Optima Souvenir"
#	DEC printers:
# FONTFAMILIES="$STANDARD13 AvantGarde Lubalin NewCentury Souvenir"
#	AB Dick printers:
# FONTFAMILIES="$STANDARD13 Bookman Garamond Optima Palatino Souvenir Zapf"

# DWB20
DWB20=FALSE

# PATH
#	The list of directories that is searched in order to run programs.
#	This is explained in the /bin/sh documentation.  If the installation
#	aborts because certain system programs cannot be found, change this
#	entry to include the correct directories, and follow the directions
#	for re-running the installation.  Be especially careful to look at
#	the PATH for "root", since much of the installation is run under
#	that account.  It is OK to have directories in the list twice, and
#	to have non-existent directories in the PATH.  The PATH below adds
#	the directories that are most often left out.
