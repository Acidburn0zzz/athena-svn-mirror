<OL>
<LI>Follow the instructions to 
<a href="http://www.magnicomp.com/download/">Download</a> and unpack
a distribution.  You can
either download complete source and build (compile) from scratch, or you
can choose to download a precompiled (binary) distribution.  
We recommend that you use the binary
distributions if
there is one available for your platform.
You must download the source and compile otherwise.  Please note that 
<b>sysinfo</b> should only be run on the same OS version as it was compiled
on.  i.e. If compiled on SunOS 5.5, do not run the same binary on 5.6.
If you attempt to do this, <b>sysinfo</b> will issue a warning.
<LI>Read the <a href="RELEASE_NOTES.html">RELEASE_NOTES</a> <EM>BEFORE</EM>
proceeding.
<LI>If compiling from source:
<OL>
<LI>Read the comments in `Makefile' and make any necessary changes.
The defaults should be fine for most sites.  You may want
to change the <b>PREFIX</b> and/or <b>CONFDIR</b> variables.

<LI>Run `<kbd>make</kbd>'.  Please note the following:
<UL>
<LI>You will almost always need to compile <b>sysinfo</b> on <EM>EACH</EM>
	version of your operating system (OS).
<LI>Starting with Solaris 7 and later, you will need two binaries for each
version of the OS - one for 32-bit systems and one for 64-bit systems (all
<b>Ultra</b> machines are 64-bit).
You can check which version you are running by looking at the
first line of <b>/etc/motd</b>
for the phrase "64-bit".
<p>
To build a binary of <b>sysinfo</b> for a system running a 64-bit kernel,
you must have a compatible compiler.  Sun Compiler 5.0 is the first Sun
compiler to support this via the <b>-xarch=v9</b> option.  At the time
this document was written there was no version of GCC which supports 64-bit
compiles.
</p>
<p>
By default, the <kbd>make</kbd> will build a binary that runs on the local
system.  You can also force <kbd>make</kbd> to build a 64-bit binary on a 
32-bit system and vice-versa.  To build a 64-bit binary on a 32-bit system,
set the environment variable <b>KISA</b> to be <b>sparcv9</b>.  To build
a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system, set <B>KISA</b> to be <b>sparcv8</b>.
i.e. For csh users:
<PRE>
	setenv KISA sparcv9
</PRE>
For sh/ksh users:
<PRE>
	KISA=sparcv9
	export KISA
</PRE>
</p>
<LI>Under SunOS 4.x, you must compile <b>sysinfo</b>
 for each kernel architecture
	(karch) and each OS version.  i.e. "sun4c SunOS 4.1.4", "sun4m SunOS
	4.1.4", etc.  This is not necessary under SunOS 5.x.
</UL>
</OL>
<LI>Continue with the following instructions for both source compiles and
binary distribution downloads...
<LI>Run `<kbd>make test</kbd>' to run sysinfo right now as a test.  This should
be done as `root' in order for <b>sysinfo</b> to function properly.

<LI>To install the sysinfo program and all required files, run
`<kbd>make install</kbd>'.
If you are installing a <b>Binary</b> distribution and installed 
the config
files into a non-default location (somewhere other than 
<b>/var/local/sysinfo/conf</b>), you need to create a file called
<b>/etc/sysinfo.cf</b> with the entry:
<PRE>
	ConfDir <i>Dir</i>
</PRE>
where <I>Dir</I> is the directory the <b>*.cf</b> files where installed in.

<LI>To install man pages, run `<kbd>make install.man</kbd>'.

<LI>You may need a license to run SysInfo.  Go to 
<a href="http://www.magnicomp.com/sysinfo">http://www.magnicomp.com/sysinfo</a>
