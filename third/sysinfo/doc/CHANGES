	* Add support for Xylogics SV-{6,7}8xx IPI controller for Suns

	* Add changes from Guy Harris:
	Added an entry for the SPARCengine 1E (6U Eurocard based on the
	SPARCstation 1; there are also SS2-based and, coming up, SS10-based
	SPARCengines, although they're not VME cards).
 
 	Changed the description of the FPA from "Wietek FPA" to "Sun-3 FPA" (it
	uses Weitek - not "Wietek" chips, but it's a Sun product), and expanded
	the extra description to note that it's Weitek-based.
	 
	Added support for various devices on Auspex systems (which required
	adding a hack to get around a botch in the "mb_device" table in our
	current drivers for some of those devices).
 
 	Separated disks from CD-ROMS, giving each its own probe routine; the
	disk probe routine will, if a CD-ROM in the drive happens to have a
	label (as some Sun CD-ROMs do, and as the Auspex system software
	distribution CD-ROM does), act as if the label is something it should
	report (it shouldn't; for example, it should report the disk as a
	CD-ROM, not whatever glop appears in the label).
 
 	Fixed "ProbeTapeDrive()" to use the no-rewind device, so that it doesn't
	run the risk of rewinding the tape out from under somebody.
 
 	Put comments at the front of the probe routines for tapes and CD-ROMs to
	indicate that they may fail even if the device exists - i.e., if there's
	no medium in the drive, or if somebody's using the tape drive;
	unfortunately, I don't know of a good fix for that problem.
