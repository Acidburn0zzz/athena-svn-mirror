License Information

In order to fund future improvements to SysInfo, a new license scheme is
introduced with version 3.5. The new license allows no-cost use by
non-profit (government and military organizations are not eligible) and
educational institutions and requires payment for use by all other users.
More information, including pricing is available by clicking here

SysInfo will automatically allow 60-days of free use for demonstration
purposes whenever run if there is no license available.

SysInfo will automatically detect if it's being run on an educational or
non-profit system if the domain name of the system is one of the known
educational or non-profit domains. Currently this includes:

   * .edu
   * .edu.CC
   * .cc.state.us
   * .ac.CC
   * .uni-*.de
   * .org

where CC is a country code. All other institutions must register and request
a (free) license.

   * Provide information on storage partitions.   SysInfo now provides a
     list of all storage partitions and their usage, if available. This
     information provides data regardless of whether a partition is directly
     on a hard disk or on a "meta" device provided through Veritas or other
     storage management software.

     The information collected includes:
        o Entry type
        o Dev Path e.g. /dev/c0t0s1
        o Dev Name e.g. c0t0
        o Basename e.g. c0t0s1
        o Name e.g. s1
        o Part # for this disk e.g. 1
        o Type e.g. ufs
        o Description of Type
        o Numeric value of Type if any
        o String value for Usage (below)
        o Mount Name e.g. /usr
        o Mount Options e.g. rw,quota
        o Size of partition in bytes
        o Amt of space currently used
        o Size of 1 sector
        o Starting Sector #
        o Ending Sector #
        o Number of Sectors (size)

     Here are 2 examples:

             c0t0d0s0        is a 7.9 GB ufs partition in use as /
                 Name                  : c0t0d0s0
                 Device Path           : /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s0
                 Usage Status          : FILESYSTEM
                 Mount/Usage           : /
                 Mount/Usage Options   : rw suid dev=2580000 largefiles
                 Type                  : ufs
                 Size                  : 7.9 GB
                 Amount In Use         : 5.5 GB
                 Sector Size           : 512
                 # of Sectors          : 16469712

             c0t0d0s1        is a 400 MB SWAP partition
                 Name                  : c0t0d0s1
                 Device Path           : /dev/dsk/c0t0d0s1
                 Usage Status          : SWAP
                 Type                  : SWAP
                 Size                  : 400 MB
                 Sector Size           : 512
                 Starting Sector       : 16469712
                 Ending Sector         : 17289215
                 # of Sectors          : 819504

   * C callable API.   SysInfo now provides a documented C callable API for
     embedding SysInfo into C applications. The API abstracts and cleans up
     the previously undocumented API. See mcSysInfo(3) for the API
     documentation.

   * Major restructuring of code.   The entire source code base has been
     re-organized and broken into distinct subdirectories.

   * GNU autoconfigure configuration.   The GNU autoconfigure (i.e.
     configure) is now used to configure the source code for compilation.
     See the Installation (INSTALL.html or INSTALL.txt) documentation for
     more information.

   * Improved SCSI device support.   The SCSI code has undergone another
     upgrade to support the SCSI-3 standard. Detailed information is also
     now supported for CD/DVD devices which support the SCSI "CD" query.

   * Improved ATA/ATAPI device support.   The ATA/ATAPI (aka IDE) code has
     undergone a major upgrade and now is compliant with ATA-1 through
     ATA-3.

   * Full Linux support.   Support for Device class information has been
     added thanks to newly added features in the Linux 2.2 kernel.

   * Improved installation.   The installation of binary (precompiled)
     distributions has been much improved with the introduction of the setup
     (installation) program. See the Installation (INSTALL.html or
     INSTALL.txt) documentation for more information.

   * Improved DOS Partition information.   Supported for decoding DOS
     parititon information has been revised significantly. SysInfo now
     understands how to decode Extended DOS partition information.

   * Automatic detection of the configuration file directory.   SysInfo will
     now find it's own configuration files (i.e. the config directory)
     automatically. It does this by looking for the config directory
     relative to where the program is installed. See the sysinfo(1) man page
     for more information.

   * Cleaner runtime for multiple OS versions.   SysInfo now has a much
     improved method of installing and supporting multiple versions of an OS
     from one sysinfo installation directory. The primary, user run, sysinfo
     program is now a wrapper script (formerly called metasysinfo in
     previous releases) which runs the appropriate SysInfo binary based on
     OS specific runtime configuration rules.

   * Miscellaneous bug fixes and platform updates.   See the CHANGES file
     for more information.

Changes from Previous Releases

Please see the Version 3.5 Release Notes for information about that release.

Platform Specific Notes

 HP-UX               When obtaining software class information on HP-UX,
                     SysInfo may appear to be sluggish taking several
                     minutes to gather information depending on the speed
                     and hardware configuration of the system. It may also
                     use lots of memory (20-70MB). These problems are due
                     to the use of the HP-UX swlist command which is both
                     slow in outputing information and copious in its
                     output.

 Solaris 7 and later Special compilation care is required on Solaris 7 and
                     later. See the Solaris 7 and later compilation notes
                     in the Installation documentation.

 Sun/SPARC EDID      VESA Extend Display Identification Data (EDID) for
                     monitors appears to only be available from Creator
                     Series 2 (FFB2) and later Creator frame buffers. No
                     sign of EDID data on any other Sun framebuffer so
                     far.

 Linux               Support for device class information is provided for
                     Linux systems which run the Linux 2.2 or later
                     kernel. Only devices connected to the PCI bus will be
                     recognized by SysInfo even if Linux recognizes the
                     device. Devices connected to ISA, EISA, MicroChannel,
                     or other legacy buses will not be identified by
                     SysInfo.

 FreeBSD             On FreeBSD 4.0 and later, devices on PCI buses are
                     recognized. On releases prior to 4.0, both PCI and
                     ISA bus devices are recognized. There is no EISA
                     support.
