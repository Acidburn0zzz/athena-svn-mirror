License Requirements

License Requirements Overview

SysInfo requires a license file containing valid license information for
permament use. If no license is provided, then SysInfo will run in DEMO mode
for 60 days. During this DEMO period, SysInfo will provide the same
information as is provided with a license as well as a warning message
stating that it is running in DEMO mode.

There is one exception to requiring a license file. If your Internet domain
name is one of the domains known to SysInfo to be used exclusively by
non-profit educational institutions such as .edu, then no license file is
required. In this case, SysInfo will function as if a license file is
present. No additional licensing is required.

Obtaining a License

You can purchase SysInfo licenses by following these steps:

  1. In a web browser, go to http://www.MagniComp.com/cgi-bin/mcservices.cgi
  2. If you do not already have an account, click on Create Account to
     create an account.
  3. Now log in by entering your Username and Password.
  4. Click on Purchase and following the instructions to complete the
     purchase process.
  5. Once you have completed purchasing a license, your license will be
     emailed to the address you gave. Save the license to a file called
     license.mcl.

Overview

There are two different installation methods for installing SysInfo. Please
choose one of the following:

   * Binary (precompiled) distributions. Everything you need is precompiled
     and ready to install. This is the fastest and easiest means of
     installing SysInfo.

   * Source distributions. Full source code is provided to build your own
     executable version. This method usually requires much more time and
     attention to detail to get things like C compiler software and versions
     right. It offers slightly more control over runtime configuration. This
     installation method is only recommended for advanced system
     administrators.

Binary Distribution Installation

Prerequisites

   * Have your license file ready if you are installing a permament license
     now. See the License Requirements section for more information.

   * Make sure you read the RELEASE_NOTES.html (or RELEASE_NOTES.txt) file
     before proceeding. This file contains valuable information on what
     system platforms are supported.

Installation Instructions

  1. Follow the instructions to Download the appropriate distribution for
     your system. You should have a file named sysinfo-4.0.2-os-arch.tar.gz
     e.g. For a SunOS SPARC distribution, the file would be called
     sysinfo-4.0.2-sunos-sparc.tar.gz

  2. Unpack the distribution:

        gzip -d sysinfo-4.0.2-os-arch.tar.gz | tar -xf -

  3. Change directory into the newly unpacked distribution directory:

        cd sysinfo-4.0.2-os-arch

  4. Become user `root' be running su or logging in as `root'.

  5. To perform an interactive installation where you will be prompted for
     required information, run the setup (installation) program with no
     arguments and follow the directions:

        ./setup

     If you wish to perform a non-interactive installation which will not
     prompt for any information, run the following:

        ./setup --confirm --acceptlicense --installdir=dir

     where dir is the name of the directory where you want to install into.
     You may also want to use the --override option which will override any
     detected error conditions which would otherwise result in being
     prompted for a response.

  6. Installation is now complete.

Source Distribution Build and Installation

Prerequisites

   * Have your license file ready if you are installing a permament license
     now. See the License Requirements section for more information.

   * Make sure you read the RELEASE_NOTES.html (or RELEASE_NOTES.txt) file
     before proceeding. This file contains valuable information on what
     system platforms are supported.

   * Make sure you have a supported C compiler. SysInfo usually, but not
     always, supports GNU's GCC compiler. However, GCC does not always
     provide full support for SysInfo features. This is especially true on
     systems running Solaris 7 and later in 64-bit mode. Please read the
     RELEASE_NOTES for platform specific information.

Compilation Notes

   * Supported Platforms. SysInfo uses GNU autoconfigure (i.e. A
     "./configure" script) to configure many system parameters before
     compilation. However, this does not mean SysInfo will work on any
     system. SysInfo contains very specific support for specific platforms
     as specified in the RELEASE_NOTES.

   * Compiling for different OS versions: In general, SysInfo will run on
     the OS version you compiled it on and future releases. It will not run
     on an OS older than the OS version it was compiled on. There are
     exceptions to this, including those mentioned below for Solaris.
     SysInfo defines some (cryptic) rules for each OS which specify these
     what OS versions a binary runs on. These rules are defined in
     config/os.rcf where os is the name of the OS in lower case. e.g.
     config/sunos.rcf is the SunOS/Solaris rule file.

   * Solaris 7 and later: Starting with Solaris 7 and later, you will need
     two binaries for each version of the OS - one for 32-bit systems and
     one for 64-bit systems. (All Ultra machines are 64-bit). You can check
     which version you are running by looking at the first line of /etc/motd
     for the phrase "64-bit".

     To build a binary of SysInfo for a system running a 64-bit kernel, you
     must have a compatible compiler. Sun Workshop (now Forte) Compiler 5.0
     is the first Sun compiler to support this via the -xarch=v9 option. GCC
     is suppose to support 64-bit compiles via the -m64 option in GCC 2.95.2
     and later, however MagniComp has been unable to make this work.

     By default, a binary that runs on the local system will be built. You
     can force a build of a 64-bit binary on a 32-bit system and vice-versa.
     To build a 64-bit binary on a 32-bit system, set the environment
     variable KISA to be sparcv9. To build a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit
     system, set KISA to be sparcv8. i.e. For csh users:

        setenv KISA sparcv9

     For sh/ksh users:

        KISA=sparcv9
        export KISA

   * SunOS 4.x (Solaris 1.x). Under SunOS 4.x (Solaris 1.x), you must
     compile SysInfo for each kernel architecture (karch) and each OS
     version. i.e. "sun4c SunOS 4.1.4", "sun4m SunOS 4.1.4", etc. This is
     not necessary under SunOS 5.x (Solaris 2.x and later).

Installation Instructions

  1. Follow the instructions to Download the source distribution. You should
     have a file named sysinfo-4.0.2.tar.gz Please note that SysInfo should
     only be run on the same OS version as it was compiled on. i.e. If
     compiled on SunOS 5.5, do not run the same binary on 5.6. If you
     attempt to do this, SysInfo will issue a warning.

  2. Unpack the distribution:

        gzip -d sysinfo-4.0.2.tar.gz | tar -xf -

  3. By default, configure will choose the name of the compiler which is
     correct for the system platform. However, if you have done things like
     make cc a link to gcc this may not work correctly in some cases. See
     the Compilation Notes for more specific details.

     If you need to specify a compiler to use, then specify one now by
     setting the environment variable $CC to the name of the compiler to
     use. For csh users use:

        setenv CC compiler

     For sh/bash/ksh users use:

        CC=compiler
        export CC

     where compiler is the name of the compiler to use. i.e cc or gcc.

  4. Run the configure program to build configuration information for your
     system:

        ./configure

     Without any options configure will build SysInfo with an installation
     directory of either /opt/sysinfo or /usr/local/sysinfo if your system's
     OS does not follow the convention of /opt. If you wish to specify an
     installation directory, then use the --prefix=dir argument. For
     instance, to use /tools/sysinfo as the main directory, run:

        ./configure --prefix=/tools/sysinfo

  5. Now compile and build everything:

        make

  6. To install everything, run the following:

        make install

  7. If you are installing a license, copy the license file into
     dir/config/license.mcl where dir is the directory which SysInfo was
     installed into.

  8. The installation is now complete.
