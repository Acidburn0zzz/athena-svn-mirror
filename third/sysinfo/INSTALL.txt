                            SysInfo Installation

  1. Follow the instructions to Download and unpack a distribution. You can
     either download complete source and build (compile) from scratch, or
     you can choose to download a precompiled (binary) distribution. We
     recommend that you use the binary distributions if there is one
     available for your platform. You must download the source and compile
     otherwise. Please note that sysinfo should only be run on the same OS
     version as it was compiled on. i.e. If compiled on SunOS 5.5, do not
     run the same binary on 5.6. If you attempt to do this, sysinfo will
     issue a warning.
  2. Read the RELEASE_NOTES BEFORE proceeding.
  3. If compiling from source:
       1. Read the comments in `Makefile' and make any necessary changes.
          The defaults should be fine for most sites. You may want to change
          the PREFIX and/or CONFDIR variables.
       2. Run `make'. Please note the following:
             + You will almost always need to compile sysinfo on EACH
               version of your operating system (OS).
             + Starting with Solaris 7 and later, you will need two binaries
               for each version of the OS - one for 32-bit systems and one
               for 64-bit systems (all Ultra machines are 64-bit). You can
               check which version you are running by looking at the first
               line of /etc/motd for the phrase "64-bit".

               To build a binary of sysinfo for a system running a 64-bit
               kernel, you must have a compatible compiler. Sun Compiler 5.0
               is the first Sun compiler to support this via the -xarch=v9
               option. At the time this document was written there was no
               version of GCC which supports 64-bit compiles.

               By default, the make will build a binary that runs on the
               local system. You can also force make to build a 64-bit
               binary on a 32-bit system and vice-versa. To build a 64-bit
               binary on a 32-bit system, set the environment variable KISA
               to be sparcv9. To build a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system,
               set KISA to be sparcv8. i.e. For csh users:

                       setenv KISA sparcv9

               For sh/ksh users:

                       KISA=sparcv9
                       export KISA

             + Under SunOS 4.x, you must compile sysinfo for each kernel
               architecture (karch) and each OS version. i.e. "sun4c SunOS
               4.1.4", "sun4m SunOS 4.1.4", etc. This is not necessary under
               SunOS 5.x.
  4. Continue with the following instructions for both source compiles and
     binary distribution downloads...
  5. Run `make test' to run sysinfo right now as a test. This should be done
     as `root' in order for sysinfo to function properly.
  6. To install the sysinfo program and all required files, run `make
     install'. If you are installing a Binary distribution and installed the
     config files into a non-default location (somewhere other than
     /var/local/sysinfo/conf), you need to create a file called
     /etc/sysinfo.cf with the entry:

             ConfDir Dir

     where Dir is the directory the *.cf files where installed in.
  7. To install man pages, run `make install.man'.
  8. You may need a license to run SysInfo. Go to
