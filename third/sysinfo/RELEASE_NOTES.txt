                          SysInfo 3.5 Release Notes

New License

In order to fund future improvements to SysInfo, a new license scheme is
introduced with version 3.5. The new license allows no-cost use by
non-profit and educational institutions and requires payment for use by all
other users. More information, including pricing is available by clicking
here

SysInfo will automatically detect if it's being run on an educational or
non-profit system if the domain name of the system is one of the known
educational or non-profit domains. Currently this includes:

   * .edu
   * .edu.CC
   * .ac.CC
   * .uni-*.de
   * .org

where CC is a country code. All other institutions must register and request
a (free) license.

SysInfo will automatically allow 60-days of free use for demonstration
purposes whenever run with no license found.

New Platform Support

 Solaris 7 (SunOS    Full support for all Solaris 7 systems, including
 5.7)                64-bit (UltraSPARC) systems.

 IRIX 6.5            Add support for IRIX 6.5.

 Linux 2.0 on x86    This is the first version of SysInfo to include
                     support for Linux. All but device (hardware)
                     information is available. Linux 2.1 should also work,
                     but hasn't been tested. See Linux Notes for more
                     information.

 FreeBSD on x86      Introducing support for FreeBSD on x86 systems.
                     FreeBSD versions 2.2.x are supported. Version 3.0
                     will be supported in the next release.

 BSD/OS on x86       Introducing support for BSDi's BSD/OS on x86 systems.
                     BSD/OS 3.1 and 4.0 are supported.

 HP-UX 11.0          Add support for HP-UX 11.0.

Major New Features/Improvements

A complete list of changes in this release is available by reading the
CHANGES file provided with the distribution.
 HPUX                   Full device (hardware) support is now provided for
                        HP-UX 10 and later systems.

 New -msglevel option   A major revamp of how messages are output from
                        SysInfo has been performed. All output is now
                        classified and output through the SImsg() call. The
                        -msglevel option modifies what types of messages
                        are output.

 New /etc/sysinfo.cf    A new file called /etc/sysinfo.cf has been
                        introduced to make binary distributions of SysInfo
                        more easily installed. This file uses the same
                        syntax as described in sysinfo.cf(5) which now
                        supports the ConfDir PathName directive. By
                        specifing a PathName you can override the value of
                        CONFDIR compiled into SysInfo. For example, to use
                        /net/sysinfoserver/conf as your SysInfo
                        configuration directory, you could create a file
                        /etc/sysinfo.cf with the line:

                                ConfDir /net/sysinfoserver/conf

 New Device Fields      Devices now have several new fields: Vendor,
                        Serial, Revision, ClassType, Driver. The Model name
                        no longer includes the Vendor name in most cases.
                        These should be visible in "-level all" output as
                        well as in the DevInfo_t data type.

 New General Field      A new field called OS Distribution has been added.
                        This field shows information about a particuliar
                        distribution of a version of an OS. For instance,
                        Solaris 2.6 HW2 SPARC.

 New and Improved SCSI  The existing SCSI query support for SunOS has been
 Support                greatly improved and new information added. The
                        code is now generalized and is now used on BSD/OS,
                        FreeBSD, HP-UX, and IRIX.

 Improved Monitor Info  SysInfo can now process VESA Extend Display
                        Identification Data (EDID) to provide lots of
                        information about monitors. This information is so
                        far only available on Sun hardware. See the Sun
                        EDID note below.

 Improved PCI Device    Information about PCI devices in general has been
 Info                   consolidated and generalized across multiple OSs.
                        See config/pci.cf.

 HW+SW Disk Info        SysInfo now differentiates between disk information
                        (geometry, etc.) obtained directly from the
                        hardware (such as via a SCSI query) versus what is
                        obtained from the OS. Output from "-level all" is
                        marked as "HW" for hardware and "SW" for software.

 New RunTime Platform   SysInfo now checks at runtime to make sure it's
 Check                  running on the same platform (Kernel Arch, OS Name,
                        OS Version) as it was compiled on.

 New RunTime Root       SysInfo now checks at runtime to make sure it's
 Check                  being run as root (uid==0) on most platforms. If
                        it's not, a warning message is issued.

 Performance            Performance should be noticable improved,
 Improvements           especially on systems with lots of hardware.
                        Several key changes where made to how SysInfo
                        builds its list of devices which should reduce CPU
                        and the real amount of time it takes to run
                        SysInfo.

 Reduced Stack, Buffer  A review of static buffer size usage was done and
 Handling               many items where fixed. A more comprehensive review
                        should still be done.

 DOS FDISK Partitions   Generalized support for showing DOS FDISK partition
 on x86                 information on x86 machines was added.

 Sun dual port disks    Dual ported disks on Sun's should now only show up
                        once. This code should work on all other platforms
                        also, since it uses the hardware device Serial
                        Number to uniquely identify each disk.

Platform Specific Notes

 Solaris 7      Starting with Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7), you will need two
                binaries for each version of the OS - one for 32-bit
                systems and one for 64-bit systems (all Ultra machines are
                64-bit). You can check which version you are running by
                looking at the first line of /etc/motd for the phrase
                "64-bit".

                To build a binary of sysinfo for a system running a 64-bit
                kernel, you must have a compatible compiler. Sun Compiler
                5.0 is the first Sun compiler to support this via the
                -xarch=v9 option. At the time this document was written
                there was no version of GCC which supports 64-bit
                compiles.

 Sun/SPARC EDID VESA Extend Display Identification Data (EDID) for
                monitors appears to only be available from Creator Series
                2 (FFB2) and later Creator frame buffers. No sign of EDID
                data on any other Sun framebuffer so far.

 Linux          There is no support for devices in SysInfo on Linux
                platforms at this time. This is due to lack of a
                consistant kernel interface for acquiring such
                information. The Linux core developers are aware of this
                lack and plan to add appropriate plumbing in a future
                Linux kernel. That is likely to be Linux 2.4, but may not
                make that release.

 FreeBSD        There is currently support for finding devices on PCI and
                ISA buses. There is no EISA support.
