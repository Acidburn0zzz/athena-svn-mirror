                      * A variety of different kernel parameters
                      * A variety of different system configuration parameters

                   Most of the OS specific information was determined by
                   groveling /usr/include/{sys,machine,*dev}/*.h files, section
                   4 man pages, and reverse engineering the output from various
                   commands like devinfo (SunOS) and using the trace(2)
                   facility. Some of the network (netif) code was inspired by
                   the sources to the 4.3BSD netstat and ifconfig commands.

                                        Click To Download

                   Installation

                     1. Follow the instructions to Download and unpack a
                        distribution. You can either download complete source
                        and build (compile) from scratch, or you can choose to
                        download a precompiled version. Use the precompiled
                        distributions if there is a distribution available for
                        your platform and the default path to sysinfo
                        configuration files (/var/local/conf/sysinfo) is
                        acceptable. You must download the source and compile
                        otherwise. Please note that sysinfo should only be run
                        on the same OS version as it was compiled on. i.e. If
                        compiled on SunOS 5.5, do not run the same binary on
                        5.6.
                     2. If compiling from source:
                          1. Read the comments in `Makefile' and make any
                             necessary changes. You probably will want to change
                             the PREFIX and/or CONFDIR variables.
                          2. Run `make'. Please note the following:
                                + You will almost always need to compile SYSINFO
                                  on _EACH_ version of your operating system
                                  (OS).
                                + Under SunOS 4.x, you must compile SYSINFO for
                                  each kernel architecture (karch) and each OS
                                  version. i.e. "sun4c SunOS 4.1.4", "sun4m
                                  SunOS 4.1.4", etc. This is not necessary under
                                  SunOS 5.x.
                     3. Continue with the following instructions for both source
                        compiles and binary distribution downloads...
                     4. Run `make test' to run sysinfo right now as a test.
                     5. To install the sysinfo program, you can either use `make
                        installmeta' (read the file `metasysinfo' for details)
                        or you can run `make install'.
                     6. Run `make install.man' to install the man page.

                   Platform Notes

                   The following are notes regard specific platforms:

                      * SunOS 4.x

                        SYSINFO should be compiled for each kernel architecture
                        machine you wish to run it on. This is only needed for
                        SunOS 4.x. It is _NOT_ required for Solaris 2.x/SunOS
                        5.x. (SYSINFO is normally installed into /usr/kvm and
                        symlinked into something like /usr/local/bin.) This is
                        necessary if you wish to be able to get the PROM version
                        information. The SunOS 4.x interface to the PROM
                        information does not permit having one binary that can
                        determine the PROM information on all the different
                        kernel architectures. This interface problem is fixed in
                        Solaris 2.x/SunOS 5.x.

                        Your kernel must have NIT (Network Interface Tap)
                        compiled into it in order to determine the Ethernet MAC
                        address under SunOS 4.x.

                      * Solaris 2.4/SunOS 5.4

                        Due to a change in SunOS 5.4, "ROM Version" information
                        is not shown unless Sun patch 102555-01 or later is
                        installed. This problem does not exist in SunOS 5.5
                        because Sun added a new interface to get this
                        information.

                      * Solaris 2.x/SunOS 5.x

                        Unlike SunOS 4.x, you only need one SYSINFO binary for
                        each Solaris 2.x release. You do not need one for each
                        kernel architecture. i.e. SYSINFO compiled under Solaris
                        2.2 on a SPARC machine will run on any Solaris 2.2 SPARC
                        machine of any kernel architecture.

                        Under Solaris 2.2 FCS on sun4d hosts (like the
                        SPARCcenter-2000), the kernel has an empty value for the
                        system "root nexus". This means that you will not see a
                        proper device tree on such systems. Various nodes will
                        not be attached where they should be. This bug cropped
                        up between Solaris 2.2 ER2 and FCS and is fixed in
                        Solaris 2.3.

                      * HP

                        HP 9000 800 series machines are not supported unless
                        running HP-UX 10.0 or later.

                      * IRIX

                        The IRIX OS comes with a command called "sysinfo"
                        (/sbin/sysinfo) that shows a system's serial number.
                        This normally should not present a problem since this
                        program is not normally used by users (/sbin should not
                        be in a normal user's $PATH) and is normally only run by
                        programs using the explicit path of /sbin/sysinfo.
                        However, if you do wish to install sysinfo using another
                        name you may do so by setting the ${PROG} variable in
                        Makefile.

                      * AIX

                        When looking up device information, SYSINFO uses the AIX
                        "National Language Catalogs". This means that your $LANG
                        environment variable must be set correctly. If it is
                        not, SYSINFO may fail to find most device information.

                        Support for AIX 4.* is not yet availible. I don't have
                        access to such a machine yet. From what I can tell,
                        though, it should be a very straight forward port -
                        probably just modifying the Makefile.

                      * SPP-UX

                        In SPP-UX 2.0.2 you may see these errors at
                        compile-time::

                          cc: Warning on line 109 of /usr/include/sys/wait.h: a \
                              bit field must have type int or unsigned int

                        These errors are due to a bug in and/or Convex C. Convex
                        is aware of the problem and promises a fix at some
                        point. The errors can safely be ignored.

                      * Ultrix, NeXT

                        Support for these platforms has been phased out. The
                        last version of sysinfo with support for these platforms
                        is version 3.0.6 which is availible in
                        ftp://usc.edu/pub/sysinfo/obsolete.
