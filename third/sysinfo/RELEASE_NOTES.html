<h2><FONT COLOR="#000099">New License</FONT></h2>
<p>
In order to fund future improvements to SysInfo, a new license scheme is
introduced with version 3.5.  The
new license allows no-cost use by non-profit and educational institutions
and requires payment for use by all other users.  More information, including
pricing is available by clicking
<a href="http://www.magnicomp.com/cgi-dat/mcservices.cgi">here</a>
</p>
<p>
SysInfo will automatically detect if it's being run on an educational 
or non-profit system
if the domain name of the system is one of the known educational or
non-profit domains.
Currently this includes:
<UL>
      <LI>.edu
      <LI>.edu.<I>CC</I>
      <LI>.ac.<I>CC</I>
      <LI>.uni-*.de
      <LI>.org
</UL>
where <I>CC</I> is a country code.
All other institutions must 
<a href="http://www.magnicomp.com/cgi-dat/mcservices.cgi">register</a>
and request a (free) license.
</p>
<p>
SysInfo will automatically allow 60-days of free use for demonstration purposes
whenever run with no license found.

<h2><FONT COLOR="#000099">Major New Features/Improvements</FONT></h2>
A complete list of changes in this release is available by reading the
<B>CHANGES</B> file provided with the distribution.
    <TABLE border=0 cellpadding=5>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>HPUX<i></TD>
	<TD>Full device (hardware) support is now provided for 
	  HP-UX 10 and later systems.
	</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New -msglevel option<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  A major revamp of how messages are output from SysInfo has been
	  performed.  All output is now classified and output through the
	  <b>SImsg()</b> call.  
	  The <b>-msglevel</b> option modifies what types of
	  messages are output.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New /etc/sysinfo.cf<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  A new file called <b>/etc/sysinfo.cf</b> has been introduced
	  to make binary distributions of SysInfo more easily installed.
	  This file uses the same syntax as described in <b>sysinfo.cf(5)</b>
	  which now supports the <b>ConfDir</B> <i>PathName</I> directive.
	  By specifing a <i>PathName</I> you can override the value of
	  <b>CONFDIR</B> compiled into SysInfo.  For example, to use
	  <b>/net/sysinfoserver/conf</b> as your SysInfo configuration 
	  directory, you could create a file
	  </b>/etc/sysinfo.cf</b> with the line:
	  	<PRE>
	ConfDir /net/sysinfoserver/conf</PRE>
	</TD>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New Device Fields<i></TD>
	<TD>Devices now have several new fields: 
	  <i>Vendor, Serial, Revision, ClassType, Driver</i>.
	  The <i>Model</i> name no longer includes the <i>Vendor</i> name
	  in most cases.  These should be visible in "-level all" output
	  as well as in the <b>DevInfo_t</b> data type.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New General Field<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  A new field called <i>OS Distribution</i> has been added.
	  This field shows information about a particuliar distribution of
	  a version of an OS.  For instance, <b>Solaris 2.6 HW2 SPARC</b>.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New and Improved SCSI Support<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  The existing SCSI query support for SunOS has been greatly
	  improved and new information added.  The code is now generalized
	  and is now used on BSD/OS, FreeBSD, HP-UX, and IRIX.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>Improved Monitor Info<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  SysInfo can now process
	  VESA Extend Display Identification Data (EDID) to provide lots
	  of information about monitors.  This information is so far only
	  available on Sun hardware.  See the 
	  <a href="#sunedidnote">Sun EDID</a> note below.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>Improved PCI Device Info<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  Information about PCI devices in general has been consolidated
	  and generalized across multiple OSs.  See <b>config/pci.cf</b>.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>HW+SW Disk Info<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  SysInfo now differentiates between disk information (geometry, etc.)
	  obtained directly from the hardware (such as via a SCSI query) versus
	  what is obtained from the OS.  Output from "-level all"
	  is marked as "HW" for hardware
	  and "SW" for software.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New RunTime Platform Check<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  SysInfo now checks at runtime to make sure it's running on the
	  same platform (Kernel Arch, OS Name, OS Version) as it was
	  compiled on.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>New RunTime Root Check<i></TD>
	<TD>
	    SysInfo now checks at runtime to make sure it's being run as
	    root (uid==0) on most platforms.  If it's not, a warning
	    message is issued.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>Performance Improvements<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  Performance should be noticable improved, especially on systems
	  with lots of hardware.  Several key changes where made to how
	  SysInfo builds its list of devices which should reduce CPU and
	  the real amount of time it takes to run SysInfo.
	  </TD</TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>Reduced Stack, Buffer Handling<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  A review of static buffer size usage was done and many items where
	  fixed.  A more comprehensive review should still be done.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>DOS FDISK Partitions on x86<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  Generalized support for showing DOS 
	  FDISK partition information on x86
	  machines was added.
	  </TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>Sun dual port disks</i></TD>
	<TD>
	  Dual ported disks on Sun's should now only show up once.
	  This code should work on all other platforms also, since it uses
	  the hardware device <i>Serial Number</i> to uniquely identify
	  each disk.
	  </TD></TR>

    </TABLE>

<h2><FONT COLOR="#000099"><a name="platnotes">Platform Specific Notes</a></FONT></h2>
    <TABLE border=0 cellpadding=5>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>Solaris 7<i></TD>
	<TD>
Starting with Solaris 7 (SunOS 5.7),
you will need two binaries for each
version of the OS - one for 32-bit systems and one for 64-bit systems (all
<b>Ultra</b> machines are 64-bit).
You can check which version you are running by looking at the
first line of <b>/etc/motd</b>
for the phrase "64-bit".
<p>
To build a binary of <b>sysinfo</b> for a system running a 64-bit kernel,
you must have a compatible compiler.  Sun Compiler 5.0 is the first Sun
compiler to support this via the <b>-xarch=v9</b> option.  At the time
this document was written there was no version of GCC which supports 64-bit
compiles.
</p>
	</TD>
      </TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i><a name="sunedidnote">Sun/SPARC EDID</a><i></TD>
	<TD>
	  VESA Extend Display Identification Data (EDID)
	  for monitors appears to only be available from Creator
	  Series 2 (FFB2) and later Creator frame buffers.  No sign of 
	  EDID data
	  on any other Sun framebuffer so far.
	</TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i><a name="linuxnotes">Linux</a><i></TD>
	<TD>
	  There is no support for devices in SysInfo on Linux platforms at
	  this time.  This is due to lack of a consistant kernel interface for 
	  acquiring such information.  The Linux core developers are aware 
	  of this
	  lack and plan to add appropriate plumbing in a future Linux 
	  kernel.  That is
	  likely to be Linux 2.4, but may not make that release.
	</TD></TR>
      <TR>
	<TD valign=top><i>FreeBSD<i></TD>
	<TD>
	  There is currently support for finding devices on PCI and ISA buses.
	  There is no EISA support.
	</TD></TR>
