Future:

- Make a Gtk-only version (compile-time option)
  (?? if enough people want this...)
- Modify the defbox widget (make one of our own?), with proper auto-wrapping.
- Enhance tne gnome_entry widget (auto-activate a-la-Netscape, flexible history 
  access) -- maybe someone is doing this already?
  
Past (pre 2.0)

- Applet doesn't compile
- Get rid of colors, font options? - TextView widget
  handles such things as italic and bold without having to
  specify the font

Past (pre 1.0):

- Add stop button to cancel a lookup
- Improve printing support (use multiple fonts).
- Improve handling of search strategies so that different servers are handled
  gracefully
