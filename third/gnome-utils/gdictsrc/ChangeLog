2002-09-19  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gdict-app.c: (gdict_app_create): Set max history to 10. Paolo

2002-08-08  Glynn Foster <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-dictionary.1: Update man page.

2002-07-29  Frederic Crozat  <fcrozat@mandrakesoft.com>

	* Makefile.am: don't add -I$(includedir), it causes
	gcc 3.1.x warning when prefix=/usr

2002-07-28  Joe Drew <hoserhead@woot.net>
	
	* Makefile.am: Clean up generated files.

2002-07-25  Paolo Maggi  <maggi@athena.polito.it>

	* gdict-app.c (gdict_app_do_lookup): if needed update the 
	the word_entry 
	(lookup_defbox): use gnome_entry_prepend_history instead of
	gnome_entry_append_history
	(lookup_button_drag_cb): ditto

2002-07-23  Irene Ryan   <irene.ryan@sun.com>

2002-07-18  Mark McLoughlin  <mark@skynet.ie>

	* GNOME_GDictApplet.server.in: move .server.in to
	.server.in.in to allow for libexec dir substitution.

2002-07-18  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gnome-dictionary.desktop.in: s/DocPath/X-GNOME-DocPath to

	* gdict.schemas.in: Add some rather needed documentation.

2002-06-12  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* main.c: (main): Unconnected the client_die_cb signal because
	gnome-session decides to kill the app after a timeout - which
	isn't nice if the app is trying to connect to the dict server.

2002-06-04  George Lebl  <jirka@5z.com>

	* gdict-app.c: use _UI_SUBTREE instead of _UI_SUBTREE_STOCK 
	since that makes translations actually work. _UI_SUBTREE_STOCK 
	means that the string comes from libgnomeui which in these cases
	it doesn't.

2002-06-02  Arvind Samptur <arvind.samptur@wipro.com>

	*  gdict-applet.c : changed gtk_main_do_event
	to gtk_propagate_event in button_press_hack

2002-05-29  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* help/C/gnome-dictionary-C.omf: Remove dtd because it screws
	up the build.

	middle click also works

2002-05-26 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* help/C/gnome-dictionary.xml
	* help/C/figures/*.png
	updated doc, new screenshots. This is likely not the final word
	(Sun version in progress), but this gives us something shippable
	that allows me to close bug #76426

2002-05-22  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add back the DESTDIR check since I don't know
	what it does and might be important.

2002-05-22  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* Makefile.am: Translates the schemas file.
	* gdict.schemas.in: New - thanks to Anders Carlsson for doing 
	cvs surgery.
	* gdict.schemas: Boot.

2002-05-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-pref.c: strdup the server pref since we try to free it
	later. Fixes bug #81941

2002-05-15  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gdict-applet.c: (gdict_applet_new):

	Restrict textbox size to a reasonable value, put

	* gdict-speller.c: left-align the items in the spell strategy
	menu.

2002-05-11  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* dict.c: Fix comment - hum, would be lovely if we could 
	somehow gnome-vfs this ;)
	* gdict-pref-dialog.c, gdict-pref.c, gdict-pref.h, 
	gdict.schemas: Fix GConf saving - for some reason it was
	broken - used this an excuse to change the schema for the
	last time.

2002-05-11  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gdict-app.c: Okay, what's the bet this comes back to 
	bite me because I'm trying to be too clever. Oh well.
	More fixes for sensitivity.

2002-05-11  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gdict-app.c: Hum, yeah, you might want to have Cut, Copy,
	and Paste sensitive even if here is no definition available.

2002-05-11  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gdict-app.c: Set the sensitivity of the menus depending on
	content of definition view. Fixes #76205.
	* gdict-pref.c: Give the settings default values just in case
	something weird happens and GConf fails - this needs to be 
	done more rigorously though. 

2002-05-10  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

       * gdict-applet.c: make the applet a text entry again. Allow
       for dragging text onto the button and add a menu item for
       looking up selected text. Also set the window icon

2002-05-10  Paolo Maggi <maggi@athena.polito.it>

	* gdict-app.h, gdict-speller.c: Move some useful functions around.

	instead. Fixes #80630.

2002-05-08  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-applet.c: copy the string from the selection since we
	don't own it. Pointed out by Håvard Wigtil - bug #80557

2002-05-07  Satyajit Kanungo  <satyajit.kanungo@wipro.com>

	the user which database the entry came from.

2002-04-26 Adam Sulmicki <adam@cfar.umd.edu>

	* gdict-pref-dialog.c: Use * instead of !. This basically has 
	the effect that it will search for all matches in a given 
	database. If this behaviour turns out to be bad, we'll revert it.

2002-04-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* GNOME_GDictApplet.xml: Remove ellipses.
	* gdict-pref-dialog.c: Rename window.

2002-04-26  Glynn Foster  <glynn.foster@sun.com>

	* gdict-app.c: Get rid of the silly progress bar. Make sure we

	g_io_channel_read, & modifying return value according

	adding seriesid to omf file

	confusion and is no longer relevant

2002-04-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-pref-dialog.c: change server and port settings
	on focus_out instead of the explicit buttons. Make the 
	buttons read "Default" so they can return the default server
	settings. This requires a docs change I think. Add some
	mnemonics

2002-03-30 Senthilkumar Ramasamy <senthil.ramasamy@wipro.com>
        * dict.c handled one more condition where both G_IO_IN & G_IO_ERR 
	is set, to avoid error dialog which pops up even when server & 
	port are valid.

2002-03-24 John Fleck <jfleck@inkstain.net>

	* help/C/Makefile.am
	* help/C/gnome-dictionary.xml

2002-03-10  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* dict.c: In the data notify, close the command if a strange
	GIOCondition is given. Popup an error dialog asking the user
	to check the server settings. This should prevent the 
	infiinite looping occurring for me and others - bug
	#72822.  

	Translators, this adds a string (though it really is a urgently
	needed string)

2002-03-05  Bastien Nocera  <hadess@hadess.net>

	* Makefile.am: revert schemas installation changes

2002-03-05  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gdict-pref-dialog.c: (create_dialog), (pref_dialog_add_db),
	(pref_dialog_add_strat), (server_button_cb): make prefs
	work again (lots of strcmp which would choke on NULL strings)
	(Closes:70274)
	* and I couldn't add a nifty maginfying glass icon to the "look up"
	button, because it's frozen :/

2002-02-17  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>
	
	* gdict-applet.c: hack to get right click working on the button

	* GDict.desktop.in:
	* Makefile.am:

	update for panel-applet GNOME_Vertigo namespace changes.

2001-12-14  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* gdict-pref-dialog.h:

	Make type use "GType" rather than guint.

2001-12-13  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-app.c: remove the space in the history id for the 
	gnome-entry. Fixes the annoying gconf error on startup

2001-12-13  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* Properly port to gconf with notification. Also get rid
	of all gnome_dialogs in favor of gtk_dialog

2001-12-12  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-applet.c: change the applet to be just a button
	that will look up text in the PRIMARY clipboard. It rocks,
	try it now ;)

2001-12-07  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* GNOME_GDictApplet.server.in:
	* gdict-about.c: (gdict_about_new):
	* gdict-app.c: (gdict_app_create):

	Change name to reflect the panel menu entry.
	
2001-12-06  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict.desktop.in: no longer used

2001-12-05  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* Makefile.am: update the .server file and make sure it gets
	created properly. Crap I forgot to cvs add the .server.in file

2001-12-05  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-applet.c: don't connect to server on 
	initialization. Lookup text from primary clipboard
	on button press instead of from the entry - some UI
	improvement needed to indicate that this will not search the
	text in the entry - perhaps replace lookup with a dict icon
	and an explanatory tooltip

	* gdict-app.c: get rid of applet_toggle gloable variable
	and add arguments to explictely state if the applet is running

2001-12-04  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	Make the applet build and run. Lots to be finished but at least
	it does something :)

	* gdict-applet.c: port to new API. 

	* Makefile.am: install the .server file

2001-12-04  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-app.c: make select all work

	* gdict-defbox.c: search now highlights the text

2001-12-04  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-app.c: support drag and drop of text onto the
	lookup button. Also add some padding to the lookup button

2001-12-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-defbox.c: apply the text attributes in a nicer fashion.
	Still a little ugly but I think it's the best I can do considering
	the TextView API

2001-12-03  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-speller.c: make find and find again work properly.
	GtkTextView rocks hard!

	* AUTHORS, TODO: add myself to authors and update TODO

2001-12-02  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-speller.c: make this derive from GtkDialog. Bind to
	activate signal for entry. Port the clist to treeview. In
	general make this dialog better :)

	* gdict-app.c: remove a GnomeDialog specific call here.
	Also add a left margin in the text box

2001-12-02  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* gdict-speller.c: remove an extra destroy call so the 
	spell dialog doesn't crash any more

2001-11-27  Seth Nickell  <snickell@stanford.edu>

	* GDict.desktop.in:

	Rename to "Dictionary", add Categories field.
	
	* Makefile.am:

	Install .desktop into datadir/applications

2001-11-20  Kevin Vandersloot <kfv101@psu.edu>

	* make ChangeLog just for gdict

	* gdict-pref-dialog.c: get rid of compile warnings by using
	gtk_editable_get_chars instead of gtk_entry_get_text

	* gdict-app.c, gdict-speller.c: ditto

	* gdict-app.c: make clearing work. Beginnings of some
	usability and cosmetic improvements
