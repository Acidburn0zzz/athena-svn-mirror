2048 [GIMPNet] [xjjk/moron@user-38ldggf.dialup.mindspring.com] with thinice2, scrolling the handlebar up and down, the

2048 [GIMPNet] [xjjk/moron@user-38ldggf.dialup.mindspring.com] ok can you tell why I don't do bug reports
2048 [GIMPNet] [msg/xjjk] so the texture is static, you just see different parts of it..
2049 [GIMPNet] [xjjk/moron@user-38ldggf.dialup.mindspring.com] yes
2049 [GIMPNet] [msg/xjjk] ok.. hm.. I could look into that..
2049 [GIMPNet] [xjjk/moron@user-38ldggf.dialup.mindspring.com] texture is static to the window, and the handlebar is 
          letting you see different parts of it
