0.51-0: January 3, 2003

  Updated to SCOWL 5 which:

    Added variants that were not really spelling variants (such as
    forwards)

    Removed some spelling variants and other strange words from the
    word list (for example meaneing).

    Removed rarly used inflections of a word.

    Removed the DEC Word List due to the questionable licence and
    because removing it will not seriously decrese the quality of SCOWL
    (there are a few less proper names).

    Among others.
