0.51-0: January 1, 2003

  Updated to SCOWL 5 which:

    Added variants that were not really spelling variants (such as
    forwards)

    Removed rarly used inflections of a word.

    Removed the DEC Word List due to the questionable licence and
    because removing it will not seriously decrese the quality of SCOWL
    (there are a few less proper names).

    Among others.
