ANNOUNCE: Bonobo Configuration Moniker (bonobo-conf 0.7)

This is mainly a bug fix release of bonobo-config, but it also includes some
new examples and improved property editors. You can now use them together with
Glade. There is also a new backend which stores configuration data as XML
files, and uses a separate file for each configuration directory.

bonobo-conf 0.7 summary:

	    - Glade support for property editors
	    - more and improved property editors
	    - default configuration moniker ("config:" without parent moniker
	      is now possible)
	    - we can now request a subtree of the whole database from the 
	      "config:" moniker
	    - wrote a nice example (examples/evolution-calendar-config.c)
	    - many small bug fixes and improvements
	    - new backend ("xmldirdb:" moniker)
	    - automatic reconnects after server errors

ANNOUNCE: Bonobo Configuration Moniker (bonobo-conf 0.2)

The second release of bonobo-conf provides two major features: First, it is now
completely independent of database backends - backends are provided through
the moniker system. You can simply plug in a new backend by providing a new
moniker. A moniker for GConf is included in this release.

The second feature is a framework to make it easy to create preferences dialogs
for applications. It is now possible to write such dialogs with minimal
programming effort. 

bonobo-conf 0.2 summary:

	    - new architecture which allows several backends
	    - new xml based file format for configuration data
	    - we use xml-i18n-tools 
	    - new GConf moniker (can be used as backend for bonobo-conf)
	    - more documentation
	    - a new widget to make it easier to create preferences dialogs from
	      PropertyControls
	    - an easy way to create PropertyControls
