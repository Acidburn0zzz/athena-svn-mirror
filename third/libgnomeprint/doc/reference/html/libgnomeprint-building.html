>Building GNOME Print on UNIX-like systems</H2
><P
>      This chapter covers building and installing GNOME Print on UNIX and
      UNIX-like systems such as Linux.
    </P
><P
>      Before we get into the details of how to compile GNOME Print, we should
      mention that in many cases, binary packages of GNOME Print prebuilt for
      your operating system will be available, either from your
      operating system vendor or from independent sources. If such a
      set of packages is available, installing it will get you
      programming wih GNOME Print much faster than building it yourself. In
      fact, you may well already have GNOME Print installed on your system
      already.
    </P
><P
>      On UNIX-like systems GNOME Print uses the standard GNU build system,
      using <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>autoconf</SPAN
> for package
      configuration and resolving portability issues,
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>automake</SPAN
> for building makefiles that
      comply with the GNU Coding Standards, and
      <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>libtool</SPAN
> for building shared libraries
      on multiple platforms.
    </P
><P
>      If you are building GNOME Print from the distributed source packages,
      then won't need these tools installed; the necessary pieces
      of the tools are already included in the source packages. But
      it's useful to know a bit about how packages that use these
      tools work. A source package is distributed as a
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>tar.gz</TT
> file which you unpack into a 
      directory full of the source files as follows:
    </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>      tar xvfz libgnomeprint-2.0.0.tar.gz
    </PRE
><P
>      In the toplevel of the directory that is created, there will be
      a shell script called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> which
      you then run to take the template makefiles called
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>Makefile.in</TT
> in the package and create
      makefiles customized for your operating system. The <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>
      script can be passed various command line arguments to determine how
      the package is built and installed. The most commonly useful
      argument is the <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>--prefix</SPAN
> argument which
      determines where the package is installed. To install a package
      in <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/opt/libgnomeprint</TT
> you would run configure as:
    </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>      ./configure --prefix=/opt/libgnomeprint
    </PRE
><P
>      A full list of options can be found by running
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> with the
      <SPAN
CLASS="SYSTEMITEM"
>--help</SPAN
> argument. In general, the defaults are
      right and should be trusted. After you've run
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>, you then run the
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> command to build the package and install
      it.
    </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>      make
      make install
    </PRE
><P
>      If you don't have permission to write to the directory you are
      installing in, you may have to change to root temporarily before
      running <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make install</TT
>. Also, if you are
      installing in a system directory, on some systems (such as
      Linux), you will need to run <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>ldconfig</B
> after
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make install</TT
> so that the newly installed
      libraries will be found.
    </P
><P
>      Several environment variables are useful to pass to set before
      running configure. <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>CPPFLAGS</TT
> contains options to
      pass to the C compiler, and is used to tell the compiler where
      to look for include files. The <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LDFLAGS</TT
> variable
      is used in a similar fashion for the linker. Finally the
      <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</TT
> environment variable contains
      a search path that <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pkg-config</B
> (see below)
      uses when looking for for file describing how to compile
      programs using different libraries. If you were installing GNOME Print
      and it's dependencies into <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/opt/libgnomeprint</TT
>, you
      might want to set these variables as:
    </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>      CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/libgnomeprint/include"
      LDFLAGS="-L/opt/libgnomeprint/lib"
      PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/opt/libgnomeprint/lib/pkgconfig"
      export CPPFLAGS LDFLAGS PKG_CONFIG_PATH
    </PRE
><P
>      You may also need to set the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT
>
      environment variable so the systems dynamic linker can find
      the newly installed libraries, and the <TT
CLASS="ENVAR"
>PATH</TT
>
      environment program so that utility binaries installed by
      the various libraries will be found.
    </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>      LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/libgnomeprint/lib"
      PATH="/opt/libgnomeprint/bin:$PATH"

>      First make sure that you have the necessary dependencies installed:
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pkg-config</B
>, GNU make, libart, libxml2, libbonobo, glib,
      and, if necessary, libintl. To get detailed information about building 
      these packages, see the documentation provided with the
      individual packages.
      On a Linux system, it's quite likely you'll have all of these
      installed already except for <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>pkg-config</B
>.
    </P
><P
>      Then build and install the GNOME Print library, follow the
      steps of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>configure</TT
>, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make</TT
>,
      <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>make install</TT

      lucky, this will all go smoothly, and you'll be ready to
      <A
HREF="libgnomeprint-compiling.html"
>start compiling your own
      GNOME Print applications</A
>.
    </P
><P
>      If the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
> scripts fails or running
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>make</B
> fails, look closely at the error
      messages printed; these will often provide useful information
      as to what went wrong. When <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>configure</TT
>
      fails, extra information, such as errors that a test compilation
      ran into, is found in the file <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>config.log</TT
>.
      Looking at the last couple of hundred lines in this file will
      frequently make clear what went wrong. If all else fails, you
      can ask for help on the gnome-print mailing list.
