Introduction
------------

Gnome Spell is GNOME/Bonobo component for spell checking. In current 0.1 version
it contains GNOME::Spell::Dictionary object, which provides spell checking dictionary
(see Spell.idl for exact API definition). It's based on pspell package, which is required
to build gnome-spell.

Dictionary object could be used for live spell checking. Look in test-spell.c or
in gtkhtml/components/html-editor/spell.c for sample usage.

In future it will be expanded by implementation of GNOME::Spell::Checker object (see
also Spell.idl) and also by spell checking dialog control with appropriate interface.

Pspell build
------------

From my experience with pspell I recommend you to build pspell/aspell this way:

	1) build and install pspell
	2) build and install aspell
	4) build and install GNOME Spell

You could get Pspell and Aspell from:

	http://pspell.sourceforge.net/
	http://aspell.sourceforge.net/

End

I hope you will find the GNOME Spell usefull.
