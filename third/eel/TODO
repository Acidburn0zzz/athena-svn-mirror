For tasks outside the porting effort, we track them as bugs in
http://bugzilla.gnome.org. For the porting effort, please let
darin@bentspoon.com know what you are working on.

Note that eel is currently "joined at the hip" to Nautilus.

Also note that all the code marked GNOME2_CONVERSION_COMPLETE
right now is covered by the items below.

- Finish porting the EelFontPicker to Pango, or remove it if
  we can replace it with something else.
- Remove basically anything Nautilus isn't using unless it's
  *incredibly* great.
	- eel_show_yes_no_dialog has unused parameters.

Accessibility open questions

	+ should EelEllipsizing label return the ellipsized
	  text ? via AtkText, currently it doesn't.

	+ with EelCaption do we have a relationset ? what
	  about if the label is hidden, do we need an AtkText
	  on the eel-caption, and prune the label's AtkObject
	  from the children ? mostly the caption is always
	  shown, could we just set the atk_object_name on the
	  caption to the label instead / as well ?

	+ should EelStringPicker have a Combo / popup role ?
