The Eazel Extensions Library is a collection of widgets and extensions
to many modules of the GNOME platform. These widgets and extensions 
were developed by hackers working on Nautilus. For the duration of
the Nautilus 1.0 development cycle, the code was internal to Nautilus
and its components.

In order to clearly distinguish useful extensions that could be useful
for other projects, we have decided to put then in their own library.
It is possible that we will move even more from Nautilus to Eel in the
future.

If you wish to use Eel for a project, have patches, suggestions and/or
you wish to discuss whether some of the extensions belong in the
library they extend, please send mail to the Nautilus mailing list:
