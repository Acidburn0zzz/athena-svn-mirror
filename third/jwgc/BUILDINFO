My primary build platform is Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).

Some 'sub-primary' platforms (IE, platforms I have access to and will try
to make jwgc compile and work on) are:
- Redhat Linux
- Solaris (sparc)
- FreeBSD
- Cygwin

I use autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.7.6 for configuring.
I also aim to keep up-to-date releases under fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net)
as well.
