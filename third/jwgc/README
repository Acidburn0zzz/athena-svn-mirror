The Jabber Windowgram Client is based entirely off of MIT's Zephyr Windowgram
Client program, and is designed to behave almost exactly the same. It supports,
or will support, most or all of the same functions that zwgc and other jabber
clients support.

If you are interested in submitting patches, places note the BUILDINFO file
for information about the environment(s) with which I develop and compile
jwgc.




Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compilation and installation should go fairly smoothly on most unix-based
operating systems.  The most simple set of instructions are:

1. Untar the distribution
2. Change into the distribution directory
3. Run: ./configure
4. Run: make
5. Run: make install

This installs into /usr/local by default, so you may need to add a --prefix
option to specify a path you have access to install into.  You should also
run configure with the --help option to see the available options.  The
options should be self-explanatory.  The defaults are in parenthesis.




Usage
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, jwgc will try to log you into the jabber server specified at
configure time, with your local unix username, and will prompt you for a
password.  You should run jwgc with -h to see how you can change these
settings at run time.  You may also want to read over the jwgc man page.

The available commands are as follows:
jwgc - the core piece that connects you to the jabber server, and handles
       all incoming and outgoing messages.  no other commands will work
       without jwgc running.

jwrite - this command allows you to send a message to another user.

jlocate - this command allows you to check your "buddy list".

jstat - this command allows you to check on the status of jwgc, and your
        connect to the jabber server.

jctl - this command contains all other functions, such as subscriptions,
       configuration, and shutdown.

All of these commands come with man pages that describe their usage.  They
should all also accept a -h flag for help.




Questions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have any suggestions, questions, bug reports, whatever.. please feel
free to either:
1. submit them via the trackers as http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/jwgc
2. drop me some email at jadestorm@users.sourceforge.net
3. drop me a jabber im at daniel@jabber.vorpalcloud.org

I hope you enjoy it!  If you don't and can think of a way that it could be
improved to make you enjoy it, let me know!
