Daniel Henninger:
Deriving most of the initial work from MIT's Zephyr system, put together a
jwgc package that works very similarly to zwgc and related programs.  I'm not
going to say much more than that about my contributions since, basically,
unless it's listed below, I probably wrote it.  =)

Mark Eichin:
Fixed a crash bug in jctl when no args were specified.

William Uther:
Added jwgc.vars support for port and ssl, as well as fixes for compiling under
MacOS X.  Also added priority support, 'fixed' system variables, and the
ability to use your hostname as your jabber resource string.

Arun A Tharuvai:
Fixed a problem where getpass was only allowing 8 characters to be accepted
for a password.  getpassphrase allows more.

Kimmo Suominen:
Fixed compile problem when SSL not available/desired.
