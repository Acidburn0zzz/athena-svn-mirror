.UC
.SH "NAME"
jwgc \- Jabber Windowgram Client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
jwgc [\-h] [\-debug <flags>] [\-f <filename>] [\-j <jid>]
     [\-u <username>] [\-p <password>] [\-r <resource>]
     [\-s <server>] [\-register] [\-ssl] [\-port <port>]
     [\-priority <priority>] [\-ttymode] [\-nofork]
     [\-default <driver>] {\-disable <driver>}*
     [output driver options]
.PP
\&\fIJwgc\fR is the base of all of \fIjwgc\fR's functionality.  It handles
connections to the Jabber server and from the various \fIjwgc\fR clients.
(such as \fIjwrite\fR, \fIjlocate\fR, etc)  You must have the \fIjwgc\fR component
running for anything else to work.  It also handles displaying incoming
messages on any output devices you have enabled.
.SH "OPTIONS AND VARIABLES"
.IX Header "OPTIONS AND VARIABLES"
\&\fIJwgc\fR is almost entirely configurable from the command line.  Almost
all of the command line options have associated variables as listed
below.
.Sh "Options"
.IX Subsection "Options"
.Ip "\fB\-h\fR" 8
.IX Item "-h"
Provides a listing of all of the available flags.
.Ip "\fB\-debug\fR \fIflags\fR" 8
.IX Item "-debug flags"
Without flags, \-debug lists all of the available debug output
types.  Otherwise, this option enables debugging output of the
specified types, or 'all' for all debugging output.
.Ip "\fB\-f\fR \fIfilename\fR" 8
.IX Item "-f filename"
Load an alternate description file.
.Ip "\fB\-u\fR \fIusername\fR" 8
.IX Item "-u username"
Username to log into the jabber server as.  If this isn't
specified anywhere, and \-j isn't specified, \fIjwgc\fR will use
your unix username.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBusername\fR
.Ip "\fB\-p\fR \fIpassword\fR" 8
.IX Item "-p password"
Password to log into the jabber server with.  If this isn't
specified anywhere, \fIjwgc\fR will prompt you for it.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBpassword\fR
.Ip "\fB\-r\fR \fIresource\fR" 8
.IX Item "-r resource"
Jabber resource to use.  This defaults to \fIjwgc\fR unless you
specify something else.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBresource\fR
.Ip "\fB\-s\fR \fIserver\fR" 8
.IX Item "-s server"
Jabber server to connect to.  This defaults to \fIjabber.org\fR
unless you specify something else.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBserver\fR
.Ip "\fB\-j\fR \fIjid\fR" 8
.IX Item "-j jid"
This option causes \-u, \-r and \-s to be ignored.  Instead, all
of this information is taken directory from the jid specified,
which tends to be of the form:
username@server/resource
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBjid\fR
.Ip "\fB\-ssl\fR" 8
.IX Item "-ssl"
Turns on ssl support.  This will try to connect to the ssl port
of the Jabber server for a secure connection.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBusessl\fR (true)
.Ip "\fB\-nossl\fR" 8
.IX Item "-nossl"
Turns off ssl support.  This can be useful if ssl is enabled
by default and you don't have ssl support on the target server.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBusessl\fR (false)
.Ip "\fB\-port\fR \fIport\fR" 8
.IX Item "-port port"
Specifies the port to connect to on the Jabber server.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBport\fR
.Ip "\fB\-priority\fR \fIpriority\fR" 8
.IX Item "-priority priority"
Specifies the Jabber priority to connect with.
.Sp
Associated variable: \fBpriority\fR
.Ip "\fB\-ttymode\fR" 8
.IX Item "-ttymode"
Enables only tty mode, which eliminates any graphical interface.
.Ip "\fB\-nofork\fR" 8
.IX Item "-nofork"
Prevents \fIjwgc\fR from backgrounding itself.
.Ip "\fB\-register\fR" 8
.IX Item "-register"
Causes \fIjwgc\fR to attempt to register your account with the Jabber
server on startup.  This is necessary to create a new account.
.Ip "\fB\-default\fR \fIdriver\fR, \fB\-disable\fR \fIdriver\fR, \fB[output driver options]\fR" 8
.IX Item "-default driver, -disable driver, [output driver options]"
These are all currently undocumented, sorry.
.Sh "Extra Variables"
.IX Subsection "Extra Variables"
The following variables have no associated command line arguments:
.Ip "\fBinitprogs\fR" 8
.IX Item "initprogs"
Programs specifed with this variable are run automatically when jwgc
is started up.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fIJwgc\fR consists of two main types of configuration files, and extra
configuration files depending on which drivers you have enabled.
.Sh "Jwgc Description Files"
.IX Subsection "Jwgc Description Files"
The \fIjwgc\fR description files are the most important piece of \fIjwgc\fR's
configuration.  They tell \fIjwgc\fR how to display incoming messages.  If
your description file is broken, then most likely nothing will be displayed
at all.  There are two instances of the description file.  One is
\&\fIjwgc.desc\fR, installed in an \fBetc\fR directory wherever the root of
your installation is.  This is the default description file users will
be using.  This can be overridden by placing a \fI.jwgc.desc\fR file in
one's home directory.  Note that this is a \-complete- override.  The
default will not be read at all if a \fI.jwgc.desc\fR exists in the user's
home directory.  As such, if a user wants to modify the output, that user
should copy the default \fIjwgc.desc\fR into their home directory as
\&\fI.jwgc.desc\fR and modify it there. 
.Sh "Jwgc Variable Files"
.IX Subsection "Jwgc Variable Files"
The \fIjwgc\fR variable files contain default settings for any of the
various variables \fIjwgc\fR uses.  These are described in more detail
later, but there are three incarnations of this file: \fIjwgc.vars\fR,
\&\fIjwgc.vars.fixed\fR, and \fI.jwgc.vars\fR.  \fIjwgc.vars\fR is a system
default file, and can be overridden by \fI.jwgc.vars\fR.  \fIjwgc.vars.fixed\fR
is a system default file that contains variables that can \-not- be
overridden by other config files, or by command line options.  Finally,
\&\fI.jwgc.vars\fR is the user's personal configuration options.  These files
don't have to exist at all for \fIjwgc\fR to function.  In fact, all of the
options in them can be specified at the command line.
.SH "DESCRIPTION FILE LANGUAGE/SYNTAX"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION FILE LANGUAGE/SYNTAX"
A description file is simply a list of commands.  Whitespace
(spaces,  tabs, and line breaks) is used to separate tokens.
The type and  amount  of  whitespace  separating  tokens  is
irrelevant.  Comments can be delimited by # and newline (for
line-oriented comments, e.g. \*(L"# this is a comment\*(R" on a line
by itself) or by /* and */ (e.g. \*(L"/* this is a comment */\*(R").
.Sh "Expressions"
.IX Subsection "Expressions"
Expressions are used by certain commands.  They are composed
from  string  literals, variable references, function calls,
and operators.  Parentheses  can  be  used  anywhere  in  an
expression to group expressions or increase readability.
.PP
String literals are specified by  putting  the  contents  in
\&\*(L"double quotes\*(R".
.PP
Variables are set using the  set  command  (see  \*(L"\s-1COMMANDS\s0\*(R",
below).  They  are referenced in an expression by using the
form \f(CW$varname\fR.  Some variables are set by default  for  each
notice.  All  other  variables  retain their values between
notice interpretations, so that if you set  a  variable,  it
retains that value until later modified.
.PP
Functions are called using a C-like syntax,
fname(expr1,expr2),  where  fname  is  the function name and
exprn are the arguments.
.PP
Binary operators use infix notation, such as \*(L"a == b\*(R".
.PP
Some commands use an expression list  (exprlist),  which  is
simply  a  set  of expressions separated by whitespace (e.g.
\&\f(CW$var1\fR \*(L"lit1\*(R" \f(CW$var2\fR).
.Sh "Variables"
.IX Subsection "Variables"
The following variables are always available:
.Ip "\fB1, ...\fR" 8
.IX Item "1, ..."
Numeric variables are assigned values corresponding  to
that  field  in  the notice (the body of each notice is
conceptually an array of fields, each terminated with a
null  character).  If  the  number is greater than the
number of fields actually in the notice, the  value  is
"".  For example, the standard jwrite messages have two
fields: \f(CW$1\fR is the signature, and \f(CW$2\fR is the text of  the
message.
.Ip "\fBdate\fR" 8
.IX Item "date"
The date on which the notice was sent.
.Ip "\fBerror\fR" 8
.IX Item "error"
An error message from the port read/write commands.
.Ip "\fBevent\fR" 8
.IX Item "event"
Event markers for messages, such as \*(L"composing\*(R".
.Ip "\fBfrom\fR" 8
.IX Item "from"
The full jabber id of the user that sent the current notice.
.Ip "\fBlongdate\fR" 8
.IX Item "longdate"
The date on which the notice was sent, in a longer format.
.Ip "\fBmessage\fR" 8
.IX Item "message"
The full text of the message, with nulls  converted  to
newlines.
.Ip "\fBnickname\fR" 8
.IX Item "nickname"
The nickname associated with the jabber id of the user
that sent the current notice, if present.
.Ip "\fBnumber_of_fields\fR" 8
.IX Item "number_of_fields"
The number of fields in the message (a string represen-
tation of a decimal number).
.Ip "\fBoutput_driver\fR" 8
.IX Item "output_driver"
The name of the output driver in use.
.Ip "\fBresource\fR" 8
.IX Item "resource"
The resource set by the user that sent the current notice.
.Ip "\fBsender\fR" 8
.IX Item "sender"
Only the username of the user that sent the current notice.
.Ip "\fBserver\fR" 8
.IX Item "server"
Only the server hostname of the user that sent the current notice.
.Ip "\fBshow\fR" 8
.IX Item "show"
This is a piece of \fBtype\fR: \fIpresence\fR notices, and can be used to
indicate more information about the user's presence.
.Ip "\fBstatus\fR" 8
.IX Item "status"
This is a piece of \fBtype\fR: \fIpresence\fR notices, and can be used to
indicate more information about the user's presence.
.Ip "\fBsubject\fR" 8
.IX Item "subject"
The subject of the messaage.
.Ip "\fBsubtype\fR" 8
.IX Item "subtype"
The jabber notice subtype of the current notice.  This depends fairly
highly on what \fBtype\fR the message is.
.Ip "\fBtime\fR" 8
.IX Item "time"
The time of day at which the notice was sent, in 24\-hour format.
.Ip "\fBtime12\fR" 8
.IX Item "time12"
The time of day at which the notice was sent, in 12\-hour format.
.Ip "\fBtype\fR" 8
.IX Item "type"
The jabber notice type of the current notice.  This can be \fImessage\fR,
\&\fIpresence\fR, or some other variety of notice.
.PP
All of these variables (except for error, output_driver, and
version) are re-set before each notice is processed.
.Sh "Functions"
.IX Subsection "Functions"
Following is a list of functions available for  use  in  the
description file.
.Ip "\fB\f(BIbuffer()\fB\fR" 8
.IX Item "buffer()"
The contents of the current output buffer.
.Ip "\fBdowncase(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "downcase(expr)"
Returns the value of expr, converted to lower case.
.Ip "\fBget(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "get(expr)"
Returns a line from the port named expr.  If  there  is
no text waiting on the port (e.g. the program connected
to the port has not printed any output), this  function
will  wait  until  it  can read a line of text from the
port.
.Ip "\fBgetenv(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "getenv(expr)"
Returns the value of the environment variable expr,  or
the empty string if it does not exist.
.Ip "\fBlany(expr1, expr2)\fR, \fBrany(expr1, expr2)\fR" 8
.IX Item "lany(expr1, expr2), rany(expr1, expr2)"
Return a number of characters equal to  the  length  of
expr2  from the beginning (lany) or end (rany) of expr1
(e.g. lany(\*(L"1234567890\*(R",\*(L"foo\*(R") would return \*(L"123\*(R").  If
expr1 is a variable reference, the variable is modified
to remove the characters returned.  If expr2 is  longer
than  expr1,  the value of expr1 is returned (and expr1
is set to "", if a variable).
.Ip "\fBlbreak(expr1, expr2)\fR, \fBrbreak(expr1, expr2)\fR" 8
.IX Item "lbreak(expr1, expr2), rbreak(expr1, expr2)"
Expr2  defines  a  set  of  characters.  The  function
returns  the longest initial (lbreak) or final (rbreak)
string from expr1 composed of characters  not  in  this
set  (e.g.  lbreak(\*(L"characters\*(R",  \*(L"tuv\*(R")  would  return
\&\*(L"charac\*(R").  If  expr1  is  a  variable  reference,  the
variable is modified to remove the characters returned.
If no characters in expr2 are in expr1, then  expr1  is
returned (and expr1 is set to "", if a variable).
.Ip "\fBlspan(expr1, expr2)\fR, \fBrspan(expr1, expr2)\fR" 8
.IX Item "lspan(expr1, expr2), rspan(expr1, expr2)"
These functions are the negation  of  the  break  func-
tions;  the  returned  string consists of characters in
the set defined by expr2
.Ip "\fBprotect(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "protect(expr)"
Returns a string which will be evaluated identically to
expr, but will not affect any surrounding environments.
That is,  any  characters  which  could  close  outside
environments  are  quoted, and any environments in expr
which are not closed at the end are closed.
.Ip "\fBsubstitute(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "substitute(expr)"
Evaluates variable references of the form \f(CW$variable\fR  in
expr and converts $$ to $.
.Ip "\fBupcase(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "upcase(expr)"
Returns the value of expr, converted to upper case.
.Ip "\fBverbatim(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "verbatim(expr)"
Returns a string that will be displayed exactly as expr
looks.  Anything  which  could  be  mistaken  for  an
environment is quoted.
.Ip "\fBjvar(expr)\fR" 8
.IX Item "jvar(expr)"
Returns the value of the jabber variable expr,  or  the
empty  string  if it does not exist.
.Sh "Operators"
.IX Subsection "Operators"
Following is a list of operators which can be  used  in  the
description file to compose expressions:
.Ip "\fIexpr1\fR + \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr1 + expr2"
String concatenation of expr1 and expr2
.Ip "\fIexpr1\fR == \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr1 == expr2"
True if the two expressions are equal, false otherwise.
.Ip "\fIexpr\fR =~ \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr =~ expr2"
True if the regular expression  pattern  expr2  matches
expr1.
.Ip "\fIexpr1\fR !~ \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr1 !~ expr2"
Negation of \*(L"=~\*(R".
.Ip "\fIexpr1\fR != \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr1 != expr2"
Negation of \*(L"==\*(R"
.Ip "\fIexpr1\fR and \fIexpr2\fR, \fIexpr1\fR & \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr1 and expr2, expr1 & expr2"
True if expr1 and expr2 are both true.
.Ip "\fIexpr1\fR or \fIexpr2\fR, \fIexpr1\fR | \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "expr1 or expr2, expr1 | expr2"
True if either of expr1 or expr2 are true.
.Ip "! \fIexpr1\fR, not \fIexpr1\fR" 8
.IX Item "! expr1, not expr1"
The logical negation of expr1.
.Sh "Commands"
.IX Subsection "Commands"
Following is a list of the commands usable in  the  descrip-
tion language:
.Ip "\fBappendport\fR \fIexpr1\fR \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "appendport expr1 expr2"
Creates a port called expr1.  All output  to  the  port
will be appended to the file expr2.  There is no input.
If the file is created, its mode is set to  read-write,
owner only (no access for others).
.Ip "\fBbreak\fR" 8
.IX Item "break"
Exits the innermost if, case, or while block.
.Ip "\fBcase\fR \fIexpr1\fR [ ((\fBmatch\fR \fIexpr\fR [,\fIexpr\fR ...]) | \fIdefault\fR) \fBcommands\fR ] ... \fBendcase\fR" 8
.IX Item "case expr1 [ ((match expr [,expr ...]) | default) commands ] ... endcase"
Evaluates  expr1.  Then, each of the match expressions
is evaluated in order.  The first  time  an  expression
matches  expr1,  then  the body of commands under it is
executed,  and  the  rest  of  the  case  statement  is
skipped.  This  compare  is case-insensitive.  default
always matches, so it should always appear as the  last
set  of commands.  See the default description file for
an example of use.
.Ip "\fBclearbuf\fR" 8
.IX Item "clearbuf"
Clears the output buffer  (see  below  for  details  on
buffering).
.Ip "\fBcloseinput\fR \fIexpr\fR" 8
.IX Item "closeinput expr"
Closes the file associated with expr.
.Ip "\fBcloseoutput\fR \fIexpr\fR" 8
.IX Item "closeoutput expr"
Sends an \s-1EOF\s0 (end-of-file) to the process if expr was a
port  created by execport, or closes the file if it was
created by outputport or appendport.
.Ip "\fBcloseport\fR \fIexpr\fR" 8
.IX Item "closeport expr"
Closes both input and output of expr as defined above.
.Ip "\fBfields\fR \fIvariable1\fR ..." 8
.IX Item "fields variable1 ..."
sets the list of variables to be equal to the fields in
the  notice.  If there are more variables than fields,
the extra variables are left empty.
.Ip "\fBexec\fR \fIexprlist\fR" 8
.IX Item "exec exprlist"
Executes a program without any input or output.  A com-
mand named by exprlist is executed.  Each expression is
used as an argument to the program; the  first  expres-
sion  names  the  program (it may be either an absolute
pathname,  or  a  program  name;  the  user's  \s-1PATH\s0  is
searched to find simple program names).
.Ip "\fBexecport\fR \fIexpr1\fR \fIexprlist\fR" 8
.IX Item "execport expr1 exprlist"
Creates a  port  called  expr1.  A  command  named  by
exprlist is executed, as described above for exec.  All
output to the port is sent to the standard input of the
process.  Reading  from the port will return the stan-
dard output of the process.
.Ip "\fBexit\fR" 8
.IX Item "exit"
Completes  processing  of  the  current  notice.  The
remainder of the description file is ignored after exe-

.IX Item "if expr1 then commands1 [elseif expr2 then commands2] ... [else commandsn] endif"
If  expr1 evaluates to true, execute commands1, etc. [A
conditional construct, similar to the constructs in the
C shell (csh).]
.Ip "\fBinputport\fR \fIexpr1\fR \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "inputport expr1 expr2"
Creates a port called expr1.  All input from  the  port
comes from the file expr2.  There is no output.
.Ip "\fBnoop\fR" 8
.IX Item "noop"
does nothing
.Ip "\fBoutputport\fR \fIexpr1\fR \fIexpr2\fR" 8
.IX Item "outputport expr1 expr2"
Creates a port called expr1.  The file  expr2  will  be
truncated, or created if it does not exist.  All output
to the port will be appended to the file expr2.  There
is  no  input.  If the file is created, its mode is set
to read-write, owner only (no access for others).
.Ip "\fBprint\fR \fIexpr1\fR ..." 8
.IX Item "print expr1 ..."
adds the values of the expressions to the current  out-
put buffer.  The  values  of  the  expressions  are
separated by spaces in the output.
.Ip "\fBput\fR [\fIexpr\fR [\fIexprlist\fR]]" 8
.IX Item "put [expr [exprlist]]"
Sends data to a port.  If expr is provided, then it  is
used  as  the port, otherwise the port used is the port
corresponding  to  the  default  output device.  If
exprlist  is  provided, the expressions in the list are
sent to the port, separated by spaces.  If it is  omit-
ted, then the contents of the output buffer are sent as
the data.
.Ip "\fBset\fR \fIvariable\fR = \fIexpr\fR" 8
.IX Item "set variable = expr"
sets variable equal to expr.  Variable  can  later  be
referenced by \f(CW$variable\fR.
.Ip "\fBshow\fR \fItext\fR \fBendshow\fR" 8
.IX Item "show text endshow"
Appends text to the output  buffer.  This  command  is
special, because the string does not need to be quoted.
Whitespace at the beginning or end of the lines of text
is ignored.  The endshow must appear as the first token
on a line (it may only be preceded on that line by whi-
tespace).  Variable  substitutions and formatting com-
mands (but not expressions or functions) are  processed
in the text.  Example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    show
\&       this is some text
\&       from: $sender
\&    endshow
.Ve
.Ip "\fBwhile\fR \fIexpr\fR \fBdo\fR \fIstatements\fR \fBendwhile\fR" 8
.IX Item "while expr do statements endwhile"
Executes statements until expr is false.
.Sh "Ports"
.IX Subsection "Ports"
Ports are an abstraction encompassing all I/O forms of which
jwgc  is  capable.  There  are  pre-existing  output  ports
corresponding to each of the output devices, and more  ports
can be created with the port commands described above.
.SH "OUTPUT"
.IX Header "OUTPUT"
The output is usually collected in  the  output  buffer  and
saved until a put command sends the output to an output dev-
ice (such as an X display or a terminal).  The output buffer
is  implicitly  cleared after each notice is completely pro-
cessed.
.PP
Output devices are implemented as output ports.  A  message
is  displayed  in a device-dependent manner when a string is
output to the port corresponding to the output device.  For-
matting  commands  are embedded in the text as @ commands of
the form \f(CW@comman\fRd(text).  Command names are case-insensitive
and  consist  of  alphanumeric  characters  and underscores.
Valid brackets are () [] {} and <>.  If the command name  is
empty  (such  as in ``@(foo)''), then a new environment with
no changes is created (This is useful to temporarily  change
some parameter of the output, such as the font).
.PP
The following output devices are supported:
.Ip "\fBstdout\fR" 8
.IX Item "stdout"
Sends the string to standard output exactly as is.
.Ip "\fBstderr\fR" 8
.IX Item "stderr"
Sends the string to standard error exactly as is.
.Ip "\fBplain\fR" 8
.IX Item "plain"
Sends  the  string  with  all  formatting  environments
removed to standard output.
.Ip "\fBtty\fR" 8
.IX Item "tty"
Does formatting on the message according to @  commands
embedded  in  the  text.  The output, with appropriate
mode-changing sequences, is sent to the  standard  out-
put.  The  appropriate  characteristics of the display
are taken from the \s-1TERMCAP\s0 entry (see  \fItermcap\fR\|(5))  for
the  terminal  named  by the \s-1TERM\s0 environment variable.
Supported @ commands are:
.RS 8
.Ip "\fB@roman\fR" 5
.IX Item "@roman"
Roman (plain)  letters  (turns  off all special modes).
.Ip "\fB@b\fR or \fB@bold\fR" 5
.IX Item "@b or @bold"
Bold letters.  If  not  available, reverse video, else underline.
.Ip "\fB@i\fR or \fB@italic\fR" 5
.IX Item "@i or @italic"
Italic  letters  (underlining, if available).
.Ip "\fB@beep\fR" 5
.IX Item "@beep"
\&\*(L"bl\*(R" termcap entry, else \*(L"^G\*(R" (beep the  terminal);
limited to once per message.
.Ip "\fB@l\fR or \fB@left\fR" 5
.IX Item "@l or @left"

output is formatted according to @ commands embedded in
the string.  Supported @ commands are:
.RS 8
.Ip "\fB@roman\fR" 5
.IX Item "@roman"
turns off \f(CW@italic\fR and \f(CW@bold\fR
.Ip "\fB@b\fR or \fB@bold\fR" 5

.Ip "\fB@small\fR" 5
.IX Item "@small"
small type size
.Ip "\fB@beep\fR" 5
.IX Item "@beep"
Ring the X bell  (limited  to  once per message)
.Ip "\fB@font\fR" 5
.IX Item "@font"
sets the current font to  the  font specified  in  the  contents of the
environment  (e.g. \f(CW@fon\fRt(fixed)).  This  will remain in effect for the
rest of the environment (a temporary change can be achieved by
enclosing  the  font-change  in  an @(...)  environment).  If the named
font is  not  available,  the  font ``fixed'' is used instead.
.Ip "\fB@color\fR" 5
.IX Item "@color"
sets the color to the color  specified in the contents  of  the
environment.  The color name should appear  in  the  X color name data-
base.  This color  will  remain  in effect for the rest of the environ-
ment.  If the named  color  is  not available,  the  default foreground
color is used.
.RE
.RS 8
.RE
.PP
Any other environment name  not  corresponding  to  the
above  environment  names  will  set the current ``sub-
style.''
.PP
The attributes of a given block of text are  determined
by any active environments, evaluated in the context of
the current style and substyle.
.PP
The style is specific to each  window.  Its  name  has
three  dot  (``.'')  separated  fields,  which  are  by
default the values of the class,  instance,  and  reci-
pient  variables,  with all dots changed to underscores
(``_'') and all letters converted  to  lowercase.  The
style  can  be  altered  by setting the style variable.
Note that it must always have exactly two ``.'' char-
acters in it.
.PP
The substyle is determined by @ commands in the message
text.
.PP
Jwgc variables which the X output device reads are:
.Ip "\fBdefault_X_geometry\fR" 5
.IX Item "default_X_geometry"
default geometry for  notices,  set from resources
.Ip "\fBX_geometry\fR" 5
.IX Item "X_geometry"
overrides  geometry in resource file, if set
.Ip "\fBdefault_X_background\fR" 5
.IX Item "default_X_background"
default background color for notices, set from resources
.Ip "\fBX_background\fR" 5
.IX Item "X_background"
overrides bgcolor in resource file, if set
.Ip "\fBstyle\fR" 5
.IX Item "style"
style, as described above
.PP
The expected geometry values are described below.
.PP
The fonts and color for a piece of text are  determined
by  the  styles  defined  in the X resources file.  The
following resources relating to text style are used  by
jwgc:
.Ip "\fBjwgc.style.stylenames.geometry\fR" 5
.IX Item "jwgc.style.stylenames.geometry"
geometry for messages of  the  specified style
.Ip "\fBjwgc.style.stylenames.background\fR" 5
.IX Item "jwgc.style.stylenames.background"
background color  for  messages  of  the specified style
.Ip "\fBjwgc.style.stylenames.substyle.substylename.fontfamily\fR" 5
.IX Item "jwgc.style.stylenames.substyle.substylename.fontfamily"
fontfamily  name for the specified style and substyle
.Ip "\fBjwgc.style.stylenames.substyle.substylename.foreground\fR" 5
.IX Item "jwgc.style.stylenames.substyle.substylename.foreground"
foreground color for the specified style and substyle
.Ip "\fBjwgc.fontfamily.fontfamilyname.size.face\fR" 5
.IX Item "jwgc.fontfamily.fontfamilyname.size.face"
specifies the fonts for a given fontfam- ily.  size
is one of small, medium, or large, and face is one of  roman,  bold,
italic, or bolditalic.
.PP
The best way to get started in customizing X  resources
for jwgc is  to  examine  the  default  application
resources and other users' resources to understand  how
they specify the default appearance.
.Sh "X Resources"
.IX Subsection "X Resources"
Other X resources used by jwgc are  listed  below.  Entries
like
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    jwgc*option: value
\&    Jwgc*option: value
\&    jwgc.option: value
\&    *option: value
.Ve
will work.
.PP
An entry labeled with jwgc*option  in  any  of  the  sources
takes  precedence  over  Jwgc*option, which takes precedence
over *option entries.  The following sources are searched in
order:
    command-line arguments (\-xrm)
    contents of file named by \s-1XENVIRONMENT\s0 environment variable
    X server resource database (see \fIxrdb\fR\|(1))
    application resources file
.PP
Logical values can be ( Yes On True T ) or (  No  Off  False
nil ).
.Ip "\fBcursorCode\fR" 5
.IX Item "cursorCode"
number of a code from the cursorfont  (should
be  an  even integer, see <X11/cursorfont.h>)
to use for the windows.
.Ip "\fBforeground\fR" 5
.IX Item "foreground"
Primary foreground color
.Ip "\fBForeground\fR" 5
.IX Item "Foreground"
Secondary foreground color (if foreground not
set) [BlackPixel is the default if neither is
set]
.Ip "\fBbackground\fR" 5
.IX Item "background"
Primary background color
.Ip "\fBBackground\fR" 5
.IX Item "Background"
Secondary background color (if background not
set) [WhitePixel is the default if neither is
set]
.Ip "\fBborderColor\fR" 5
.IX Item "borderColor"
Primary border color
.Ip "\fBBorderColor\fR" 5
.IX Item "BorderColor"
Secondary border color  (if  borderColor  not
set) [BlackPixel is the default if neither is
set]
.Ip "\fBpointerColor\fR" 5
.IX Item "pointerColor"
Primary mouse pointer color [foreground color
is the default if not set]
.Ip "\fBreverseVideo\fR" 5
.IX Item "reverseVideo"
(logical) Toggles foreground  and  background
(and  border,  if  it  matches  foreground or
background).
.Ip "\fBReverseVideo\fR" 5
.IX Item "ReverseVideo"
Secondary toggle, if reverseVideo is not set.
[off is the default if neither is set]
.Ip "\fBborderWidth\fR" 5
.IX Item "borderWidth"
Primary border width selector

.IX Item "BorderWidth"
Secondary  border  width  selector  (if  bor-
derWidth  is not set) [1 is the default value
if neither is set]
.Ip "\fBinternalBorder\fR" 5
.IX Item "internalBorder"
Primary border between edge and text
.Ip "\fBInternalBorder\fR" 5
.IX Item "InternalBorder"
Secondary  selector  (if  internalBorder  not
set)  [2  is  the default value if neither is
set]
.Ip "\fBgeometry\fR" 5
.IX Item "geometry"
Primary \s-1POSITION\s0 (not size) geometry  specif-
ier.  The  geometry  should  be  of the form
\&\*(L"{+|\-}x{+|\-}y\*(R", specifying an (x,y)
coordinate for a  corner  of  the  window
displaying the notice.  The interpretation of
positive and negative location specifications
follows the X conventions.  A  special  loca-
tion  of `c' for either x or y indicates that
the window  should  be  centered  along  that
axis.  Example:  a geometry of \*(L"+0+c\*(R" speci-
fies the window should be at the top  of  the
screen, centered horizontally.
.Ip "\fBGeometry\fR" 5
.IX Item "Geometry"
Secondary position  specifer.  [+0+0  is  the
default if neither is set.]
.Ip "\fBresetSaver\fR" 5
.IX Item "resetSaver"
(logical) Primary value to  force  screen  to
unsave when a message first appears.
.Ip "\fBResetSaver\fR" 5
.IX Item "ResetSaver"
(logical) Secondary value to force screen  to
unsave. [default True]
.Ip "\fBreverseStack\fR" 5
.IX Item "reverseStack"
(logical) Primary value to specify that  jwgc
should  attempt  to  stack WindowGram windows
such that the oldest messages  normally  show
on  top.  Some X window managers may silently
ignore jwgc's attempts to  restack  its  win-
dows.  This  option  can  cause some unusual
interactions with other windows if  the  user
manually restacks either the other windows or
the WindowGram windows.
.Ip "\fBReverseStack\fR" 5
.IX Item "ReverseStack"
Secondary value to enable  reverse  stacking.
[default False]
.Ip "\fBtitle\fR" 5
.IX Item "title"
(string) Primary window title
.Ip "\fBTitle\fR" 5
.IX Item "Title"
Secondary window title [defaults to the  last
pathname  component of the program name, usu-
ally \*(L"jwgc\*(R"]
.Ip "\fBtransient\fR" 5
.IX Item "transient"
(logical) Primary value which  determines  if
jwgc  windows  will be created with the
\&\s-1WM_TRANSIENT_FOR\s0  property  set.  If this
resource  is  true, the property will be set,
telling  certain  windowmanagers to treat
jwgc  windows specially.  For instance,
twm will not  put  decorations  on  transient
windows,  mwm  will not let you iconify them,
and uwm ignores the resource entirely.
.Ip "\fBTransient\fR" 5
.IX Item "Transient"
Secondary transient determining value
[default False]
.Ip "\fBenableDelete\fR" 5
.IX Item "enableDelete"
(logical) If true, jwgc creates a
\&\s-1WM_PROTOCOLS\s0  property  on  all  jgrams, with
\&\s-1WM_DELETE_WINDOW\s0 as contents.
.Ip "\fBEnableDelete\fR" 5
.IX Item "EnableDelete"
Secondary value  to  enable  \s-1WM_DELETE_WINDOW\s0
protocol on jgrams [default False]
.Ip "\fBminTimeToLive\fR" 5
.IX Item "minTimeToLive"
Primary value  which  specifies  the  minimum
amount  of  time (``minimum time to live'') a
WindowGram  must  be on-screen (in mil-
liseconds)  until  it can be destroyed.  This
feature  is  useful  to  avoid accidentally
clicking  on  new  WindowGrams when trying to
delete old ones.
.Ip "\fBMinTimeToLive\fR" 5
.IX Item "MinTimeToLive"
Secondary value of ``minimum time to live.''
.Ip "\fBiconName\fR" 5
.IX Item "iconName"
(string) Primary icon name
.Ip "\fBIconName\fR" 5
.IX Item "IconName"
Secondary icon name  [defaults  to  the  last
pathname  component of the program name, usu-
ally \*(L"jwgc\*(R"]
.Ip "\fBname\fR" 5
.IX Item "name"
(string) Primary window class name
.Ip "\fBname\fR" 5
.IX Item "name"
Secondary window class name [defaults to  the
last  pathname component of the program name,
usually \*(L"jwgc\*(R"]
.Ip "\fBsynchronous\fR" 5
.IX Item "synchronous"
(logical) Primary X synchronous mode  specif-
ier.  On means to put the X library into syn-
chronous mode.
.Ip "\fBSynchronous\fR" 5
.IX Item "Synchronous"
Secondary  X  synchronous mode specifier.
[default is `off']
.PP
The window class is always \*(L"Jwgc\*(R".
.Sh "X Buttons"
.IX Subsection "X Buttons"
Clicking and releasing any  button  without  the  shift  key
depressed while the pointer remains inside a WindowGram win-
dow will cause it to disappear. If the  pointer  leaves  the
window  while  the  button is depressed, the window does not
disappear; this provides a way to avoid accidentally  losing
messages.
.PP
If the control button is held down while clicking on a  Win-
dowGram,  then that WindowGram and all windowgrams under the
point where the button is released will be erased.
.PP
Portions of the text of a message may be selected for \*(L"past-
ing\*(R"  into  other  X  applications by using the shift key in
cooperation with the pointer buttons.  Holding the Shift key
while  depressing Button1 (usually the left button) will set
a marker at  the  text  under  the  pointer.  Dragging  the
pointer  with  Shift-Button1  still  depressed  extends  the
selection  from  the  start  point,  until  the  button is
released.  The end of the selection may also be indicated by
releasing Button1, holding down the Shift key, and  pressing
Button3  (usually  the right button) at the desired endpoint
of the selection.  The selection will appear with  the  text
and background colors reversed.
.PP
If jwgc receives a \s-1WM_DELETE_WINDOW\s0, it destroys the jwgc
window as if it were clicked on.
.PP
If a jwgc window is unmapped, it is removed from the stacking
order used by reverseStack.
.SH "FILES"
