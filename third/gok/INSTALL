Installing GOK
**************


Requirements
============

- GNOME 2 *

- AT-SPI *

- libwnck

- EsounD (ESD)

- m4

- To build the API reference documentation you will need gtk-doc and
  its requirements:

    Perl 5

    DocBook DTD 3.0
        http://www.ora.com/davenport

    Jade 1.1
        http://www.jclark.com/jade

    Modular DocBook Stylesheets
        http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl


* GOK can also be used with non-GNOME-2 applications and applications
written with toolkits for which an AT-SPI bridge does not exist.  In
this case GOK functions fully as an onscreen keyboard but the more
advanced dynamic features such as redisplaying an application's user
interface in a GOK keyboard will not be available.  Please see the
note below on nature of GOK's dependency on AT-SPI and the potential
for loosening it.

Building
========

To build for installation in directory PREFIX:

$ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
$ make

The --prefix argument is optional and defaults to /usr/local

Installing
==========

Become root if necessary and:

# make install

Before running GOK for the first time it is necessary to restart
gconfd.  You can use this command, run as the user under which you
started your GNOME session:

$ gconftool-2 --shutdown

or log out and back in again.

configure Options
=================

For information on how to use type:

$ ./configure --help

Additional options above standard configure options:

--enable-gtk-doc              Use gtk-doc to build documentation
                              default=yes

--enable-logging-normal       Enables logging of normal behaviour
                              default=no

--enable-logging-exceptional  Enable logging of exceptional behaviour
                              default=no

Troubleshooting
===============

Please see the README file for suggestions if you are having trouble
installing GOK.

GOK's dependency on AT-SPI
==========================

Although GOK can be used with non-GNOME-2 applications it is currently
dependent upon AT-SPI to build.  GOK uses AT-SPI for the following:

- To get information about running applications that enables GOK to
  dynamicly redisplay an application's user interface in a GOK keyboard

- To get notification on the state on the system's modifier keys

- To get core pointer button press events when the core pointer
  is outside of the GOK window

It would be possible to modify GOK so that it checked for AT-SPI in
configure.in and only compiled in the features that are dependent on
AT-SPI if AT-SPI is present.  GOK could then be built and used in a
non-GNOME-2 environment in which AT-SPI was not present.

Configuring for Input Devices
=============================

[Please see the above-named section in the README file.]
