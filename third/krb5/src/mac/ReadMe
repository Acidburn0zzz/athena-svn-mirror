----------------------------------------------------

If you have questions or comments about the Macintosh build process,
send e-mail to <macdev@mit.edu> .

You should not be building Macintosh Kerberos v5 and GSS libraries
from the standard Kerberos v5 distribution. Instead, you should look
for MIT Kerberos Library sources from
