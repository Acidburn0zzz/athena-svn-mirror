Kerberos V4 used port 750.  If necessary, you can run on
both ports for backward compatibility.

If you are fortunate enough to
have a previous version of Kerberos V5 or V4 installed, and the Kerberos
rlogin is first in your path, you can setup <TT>`.k5login'</TT> or
<TT>`.klogin'</TT> respectively to allow you access.
