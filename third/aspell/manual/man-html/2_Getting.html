2.1 Requirements
</H1>

<P>
Aspell requires gcc 2.95 (or better) as the C++ compiler. Other C++
compilers should work with some effort. Other C++ compilers for mostly
POSIX compliant (Unix, Linux, BeOS, CygWin) systems should work with
out any major problems provided that the compile can handle all of
the advanced C++ features Aspell uses. C++ compilers for non-Unix
systems might work but it will take some work. Aspell at very least
requires a Unix-like environment (sh, grep, sed, tr, etc...) in order
to build. Aspell also uses a few POSIX functions when necessary.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00320000000000000000">

2.4 Helping Out</A>
</H1>

<P>
I have very little time to work on Aspell so I desperately need other
people to help with the development of Aspell. There are a lot of
things that need to be done before I consider Aspell complete. See
section <A HREF="B_Do.html#todo">B.1</A> for a list of them. I would really appreciate
some help with doing them. If you are interested in helping with one
of them please let me know.

<P>
I am also looking for someone to eventually take over the maintenance
and development of Aspell. If you are interested please contact me
directly.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
./configure &amp;&amp; make

</BLOCKQUOTE>
For additional configure options type ./configure &#45;&#45;help. You can
control what C++ compiler is used by setting the environmental variable
CXX before running configure and you can control what flags are passed
to the C++ compile via the environmental variable CXXFLAGS. Static
libraries are disabled by default since static libraries will not
work right due to the mixing of C and C++. When a C program links
with the static libraries in Aspell it is likely to crash because
Aspell's C++ objects are not getting initialized correctly. However,
if for some reason you want them, you can enable them via &#45;&#45;enable-static.

<P>
Aspell should then compile with out any additional user intervention.
If you run into problems please first check the sections below as
that might solve your problem.

<P>
To install the program simply type

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
make install

</BLOCKQUOTE>
After Aspell is installed at least one dictionary needs to be installed.
You can find them at <TT><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://aspell.net/">http://aspell.net/</A></TT>. The &#34;aspell&#34;
program must be in your path in order for the dictionaries to install
correctly.

<P>
If you do not have Ispell or the traditional Unix ``spell'' utility
installed on your system than you should also copy the compatibly
scripts ``ispell'' and ``spell'' located in the scripts/ directory
into your binary directory which is usually /usr/local/bin so that
programs that expect ispell or spell command will work correctly.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00352000000000000000">
2.5.2 General Problems</A>
</H2>

<P>
Aspell does not use a released version of GNU Libtool. If you have
a need to modify configure.ac or any of the Makefile.am's you should
install the CVS version of libtool.

<P>

2.5.3 Curses Notes</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you are having problems compiling termios.cc than the most likely
reason is due to incompatibilities with the curses implementation
on your system. If this is the case than you can explicitly disable
the curses library with &#45;&#45;disable-curses. By doing this you will lose
the nice full screen interface but hopefully you will be able to at
least get Aspell to compile correctly.

<P>
If the curses library is installed in a non-standard location than
you can specify the library and include directory with &#45;&#45;enable-curses=&#171;lib&#187;
and &#45;&#45;enable-curses-include=&#171;dir&#187;.
<B>Lib</B> can either be the complete path of the library (for example
``/usr/local/curses/libcurses.a''), the name of the library (for
example ``ncurses'') or a combined location and library in the
form ``-L&#171;lib dir&#187; -l&#171;lib&#187;''
(for example ``-L/usr/local/ncurses/lib -lncurses''). <B>Dir</B>
is the location of the curses header files (for example ``/usr/local/ncurses/include'').

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00354000000000000000">
2.5.4 Upgrading from Aspell .33/Pspell .12</A>
</H2>

<P>
Aspell has undergone an extremely large number of changes since the
previous Aspell/Pspell release. For one thing Pspell has been merged
with Aspell so there in no longer two separate libraries you have
to worry about.

<P>
Because of the massive changes between Aspell/Pspell and Aspell 0.50
you may want to clean out the old files before installing the the
new Aspell. To do so do a ``make uninstall'' in the original Aspell
and Pspell source directories.

<P>
The way dictionaries are handled has also changed. This includes a
change in the naming conventions of both language names and dictionaries.
Due to the language name change, your old personal dictionaries will
not be recognized. However, you can import the old dictionaries by
running the ``aspell-import'' script. This also means that dictionaries
designed to work with older versions of Aspell are not likely to function
correctly. Fortunately new dictionary packages are available for most
languages. You can find them off of the Aspell home page at <TT><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://aspell.net">http://aspell.net</A></TT>.

<P>
The Pspell ABI is now part of Aspell except that the name of everything
has changed due to the renaming of Pspell to Aspell. In particular
please note the following name changes:

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
pspell -&gt; aspell
<BR>
manager -&gt; speller
<BR>
emulation -&gt; enumeration
<BR>
master_word_list -&gt; main_word_list

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Please also note that the name of the <B>language-tag</B> option
has changed to <B>lang</B>. However, for backward compatible the
language-tag option will still work.

<P>
However, you should also be able to build applications that require
Pspell with the new Aspell as a backward compatibility header file
is provided.

<P>
Due to a change in the way dictionaries are handled, scanning for
.pwli files in order to get find out which dictionaries are available
will no longer work. This means that programs that relied on this
technique may have problems finding dictionaries. Fortunately, GNU
Aspell now provided a uniform way to list all installed dictionaries
via the C API. See the file ``list-dicts.c'' in the examples/
directory for an example of how to due this. Unfortunately there is
isn't any simply way to find out which dictionaries are installed
which will work with both the old Aspell/Pspell and the new GNU Aspell.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00355000000000000000">
2.5.5 Upgrading from a pre-release snapshot</A>
</H2>

<P>
At the last minute I decided to merge the ``speller-util'' program
into the main ``aspell'' program. You may right to remove that
speller-util program to avoid confusion. This also means that dictionaries
designed to work with the snapshot will no longer work with the official
release. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00356000000000000000">
2.5.6 Win32 Notes</A>
</H2>

<P>
Due to limited time and my general dislike for Microsoft Windows,
Win32 is not an officially supported platform for Aspell. However,
it is possible for someone with experience with the Cgiwin development
environment to create an Aspell binary and library (dll) using gcc
as others have done so. The library, in theory, should be able to
be used by any Win32 compiler if it is compiled right, but this theory
has never been tested.

<P>
Aspell requires Gcc 2.95 (or better) and the Cgiwin development environment
in order to compile on Win32. Both the Cgiwin or the Mingw version
of Gcc should work. The Mingw version of Aspell will have slightly
less functionality, but none of which is noticeable to the end user.
Microsoft Visual C++, however, will not work with the released version
of Aspell as the compiler is far to buggy as far as C++ compliance
goes. However, there is a patch available which should allow Aspell
to compile using Microsoft Visual C++ which you can find at <TT><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell</A></TT>.

<P>
In order to get the nice full screen interface with Mingw when spell
checking files a curses implementation that does not require Cygwin
is required. The PDCurses (<TT><A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/PDCurses/">http://www.lightlink.com/hessling/PDCurses/</A></TT>)
implementation is known to work, other implementations may work however
they have not been tested. See the previous section for information
on specifying the location of the curses library and include file.

<P>
If Aspell is compiled with &#45;&#45;enable-win32-relocatable and the <B>bindir</B>
is set to the same value as <B>prefix</B> (ie not &#171;prefix&#187;/bin)
then the Aspell directory (what prefix is set to) can be relocated
anywhere provided that none of the data files are moved around within
the Aspell directory. Please not that this feature has not been tested
with GNU Aspell 0.50 so it may or may not work.

<P>
The default paths for Aspell are designed for a Unix system and not
a Win32 system so you might want to specify different ones when compiling
Aspell. Also if the HOME environmental variable is not set Aspell
will assume it is the current working directly. This may lead to your
personal word lists being saved in unpredictable locations. To solve
this either compile with &#45;&#45;enable-win32-relocatable (see above) or
specify the complete path of the personal and replacement word lists
in aspell.conf. If Aspell is compiled with &#45;&#45;enable-win32-relocatable
than the personal word lists are saved in the <B>prefix</B> directory
and the name is changed from ``<TT>.aspell.&lt;lang&gt;.*</TT>'' to''
<TT>&lt;lang&gt;.*</TT>''.

<P>
If you have experience with using Cgiwin or a Unix like environment
and are willing to maintain an Aspell binary and/or library I would
be willing to work with you to get Aspell to compile. If you are seriously
interested please post to aspell-devel@gnu.org after you have given
it an initial try. However, if, after reading this section, you do
not know how to start then you most likely do not have the necessary
experience to be able to get Aspell to compile. Please do not bother
me with questions such as ``I would like to use Aspell on Win32
but I have no idea what to do.'', as I am not willing to teach you
the basics of working with a Unix like environment.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00360000000000000000">
2.6 Using aspell-import</A>
</H1>

<P>
The aspell-import Perl script will look for old personal dictionaries
and will import them into GNU Aspell. It will look for both Ispell
and Aspell ones. To use it just run it from the command prompt. If
you get an error about /usr/bin/perl not being found than instead
try ``perl &#171;bindir&#187;/aspell-import''.
When running the script if you get a message like:

<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>
<DD><TT>Error:&nbsp;No&nbsp;word&nbsp;lists&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;found&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;language&nbsp;&#34;de&#34;.</TT>
</DD>
</DL> This means that you have not installed support for the given language,
in this case ``de'' for German. To rectify the situation download
and install a dictionary designed to work with GNU Aspell 0.50 or
better.
