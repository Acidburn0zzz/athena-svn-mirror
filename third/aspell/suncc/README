COMPILING ASPELL WITH THE SUN WORKSHOP COMPILER
-----------------------------------------------

The patch aspell-0.50.4.1-suncc.diff contains some additional changes
which might be required to get Aspell to compile with the Sun WorkShop
6 Compiler.  The script "suncc_build" contains some additionally hacks
which may also be required.

For more info please see the thread
http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/aspell-devel/2004-01/msg00007.html

The included patch is the same patch given by Flemming Frandsen except
that I removed the parts that were already applied.

If you are able to compile Aspell without requiring this patch and/or
build script I would appreciate hearing from you.  You can email me at
kevina@gnu.org.

If you have problems please post to aspell-user@gnu.org.  You do not
need to be subscribed to post, but if you don't subscribe I will have
to approve your message.
