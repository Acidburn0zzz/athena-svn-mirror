    <para>The &fr; is a graphical application for viewing, unpacking,
      and creating archive files. An archive file is a file that
      acts as a container for other files. An archive can contain
      many files, folders, and subfolders, usually in
      compressed form. There are many types of archives, using
      different formats and  compression methods.

  <!-- =============  Viewing a file in  an Archive ==================== -->
  <sect1 id="fr-viewing-file"> 
    <title>Viewing a File in an Archive</title> 
    <para>
      The simplest way to view a file in the archive is to
      double-click on the file in &fr; main window. Alternatively, you
      can select the file and click <guibutton>View</guibutton> button
      in the toolbar. &fr; will automatically determine the
      appropriate viewer or application for this file type (using
      information shown in <guilabel>File Types and
      Programs</guilabel> section of GNOME Control Center) and launch
      it.  If &fr; can not determine the appropriate viewer or
      application, it will prompt you to select one. 
    </para>
     <note>
      <title>Viewers and Applications</title>
      <para>
	The difference between viewers and applications is that viewers
	show file contents inside a &fr; window and thus do not require
	launching a separate application. Viewers are usually much
	faster to start but have very limited functionality
      </para>
      <para>For advanced users, we note that these viewers are not
	a part of &fr;. Instead, they are provided by other GNOME
	applications and use special technology
	(<application>bonobo</application>) which allows them to work
	inside &fr; window. Thus, the number of viewers available to
	&fr; depends on bonobo-enabled applications installed on your
	system. 
      </para>
    </note>
     <warning>
      <title>WARNING</title>
      <para>
	Please note that &fr; only allows you to view a file but not
	change it. If you open a file with an application and make any
	changes to it, these changes <emphasis>will not</emphasis> be
	saved in the archive, even if you clicked
	<guibutton>Save</guibutton> button in the application. (The
	reason is that &fr; creates a temporary copy of the file and
	then passes this copy to the application. This temporary copy
	is deleted after you close the application, and the changes are
	lost.)
      </para>
      <para>
	If you want to edit  a file in the archive and have your
	changes saved in the archive, you should <link
	  linkend="fr-extracting">extract</link>
	the file to  a temporary location, edit it, and then <link
	  linkend="fr-adding-files">add</link> this file back to the archive,
	overwriting the original.   
      </para>
    </warning>
    <para>
      You can also view a file using the viewer or application you
      specify rather than the default one. To open a file using an
      internal viewer, choose <menuchoice><guimenu>Archive</guimenu>
      <guimenuitem>View file</guimenuitem></menuchoice> or right-click
      on the filename and choose <guimenuitem>View
      file</guimenuitem>. &fr; will open the file using the most
      appropriate viewer for files of this type; if it can't find a
      viewer, it will try to show the file using text viewer.
    </para>
    <para>
      To open a file using an external application, choose
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Archive</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Open Files...
      </guimenuitem></menuchoice> or right-click on the
      filename and choose <guimenuitem>Open Files
      ...</guimenuitem>. This will open a dialog that shows all
      applications that can open files of this type. You can select
      one of them by clicking on it and then clicking
      <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. You can also manually enter the
      command to launch the application of your choice. 
    </para>

  <!-- =============  Modifying an Archive ============================= -->
  <sect1 id="fr-modifying"> 
    <title>Modifying an Archive</title> 
    <para>
      &fr; allows you to modify an archive file. There are two types
      of operations: those that affect the archive  as a whole
      (such as renaming the archive) and those that affect individual
      files or folders inside the archive. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Please note that all operations on the archive are saved to disk
      immediately. For example, if you are deleting a file from the
      archive, &fr; will delete it as soon as you click
      <guibutton>OK</guibutton> button. This is different from most
      applications which save the changes to disk only when you quit
      the application or select <guimenuitem>Save</guimenuitem> in the
      menu.

    <sect2 id="fr-adding-files">
      <title>Adding Files to an Archive</title>
      <para>
	The easiest way to add files to currently open archive is to
	drag files to &fr; window from another GNOME application (such
	as file manager). Alternatively, you can choose
	<menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Add
	Files...</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, click on the
	<guibutton>Add</guibutton> button in the toolbar, or
	right-click on a file in &fr; window and select
	<guimenuitem>Add files</guimenuitem>. This opens
	<guilabel>Add Files...</guilabel> dialog, shown in <xref
	linkend="fr-add-dialog-fig"/>. In this dialog, select the
	files you want to add and click <guibutton>OK</guibutton>.  
      </para>
      <tip id="multi-select">
	<title>TIP</title>
	<para>To select more than one file, hold down
	<keycap>Ctrl</keycap> key when selecting files. To select a
	continous block of files from the list, click on the first
	file, then hold down <keycap>Shift</keycap> key and click on
	the last file of the block. All files between them will be
	selected. 
	</para>
      </tip>
      <para>
	To add a whole folder to the archive, type the folder name in the
	<guilabel>Selection</guilabel> field.  For example, say that you 
	want to add the folder <filename>/aaa/bbb/ccc</filename> to an archive,
	in this case you have to go to folder <filename>/aaa/bbb</filename> 
	and type <filename>ccc</filename> in the 
	<guilabel>Selection</guilabel> field.  
	Note that just clicking on the folder name does not work. 
      </para>
      <para>
	<guilabel>Add files</guilabel> dialog can also be used to
	automatically select and add all files satisfying certain
	criteria. This is discussed in <xref linkend="fr-add-advanced"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
	Please note that when adding files to the archive, &fr; does
	not remove the original file; it remains unchanged. Also, the
	added file in the archive will have the same permissions and
	modification date as the original file.

	      This option controls what happens if the archive already
	      contains a file with the same name as the one you are
	      adding. If this option is unselected, the file will be
	      added, overwriting previous archive contents. If this
	      option is selected, the file will be added only if it is
	      newer than the file already in the archive (&fr; uses
	      modification time to determine which file is newer).

		This option is very convenient for keeping backups
		up-to-date. For example, assume that you have an
		archive <filename>backup.tar.gz</filename> which
		contain, in archived form, the contents of your home
		folder as it was a week ago. You want to update it
		so that it contains the contents of your home
		folder as it is now. To do so, open the archive in
		&fr;, click on <guibutton>Add</guibutton> button,
		select your home folder, select option
		<guilabel>Add only if newer</guilabel> and click
		<guibutton>OK</guibutton>. This will automatically add
		to the archive all files that have been created during
		the last week and update all files that have been
		modified during the last week. (However, it will not
		remove from the archive the files you have deleted
		during the last week.). This is much faster than doing
		full backup of your home folder.

	<guimenuitem>Extract to...</guimenuitem> </menuchoice>
      or click on <guibutton>Extract</guibutton> button in the

      explained in detail in <xref linkend="fr-extract-dialog"/>. 
    </para>
    <para>
      You can also extract only some of the files in the archive. To
      do so, select the files you want to extract in the main &fr;
      window before clicking on <guibutton>Extract</guibutton>
      button. For example, you can extract a single file from the

    <para>
      Please note that extracting files from the archive does not
      change the archive file. &fr; leaves the archive file
      unchanged. If you no longer need the archive file, you can
      delete it manually  by choosing
      <menuchoice><guimenu>Archive</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Delete
