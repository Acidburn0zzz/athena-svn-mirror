This is the examples directory inside libgnomeprintui. If you are going to be running this examples i
recommend setting your default printer to print to file, since there isn't any gui for this yet you
can modify libgnomeprint/data/printers/Generic.printer and change the line that says:
  <Key Id="Backend" Value="lpr"/>
to
  <Key Id="Backend" Value="file"/>

This examples contains code for both libgnomeprint and libgnomeprintui. To compile them you
can use "make" or "make example_0x". To debug them inside gdb you need to run them with
"gdb .libs/example_0x".

Here is a brief description of what each example does.
