OAF is the new Object Activation Framework for GNOME. OAF has a
similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME 1.x CORBA activation library, and
will replace it for GNOME 2.0.

It allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba.
Each server is described by an XML file that defines its
attributes. When querying or activating, one may specify complex
requirements using the OAF query language.


OAF requires a special version of ORBit to build. You can find it
in the `ORBit-martin-forked' module in GNOME CVS; this is a version
of ORBit 0.5.x which has been ported to use glib HEAD and its API
has been modified to be the same than ORBit2.

You can compile OAF with either ORBit-martin-forked or ORBit2; the
only thing you need to do is to recompile all your code.

OAF will start using ORBit2 now too far in the future, but currently
ORBit2 is still too unstable to be used.



Also, if you want to build the API documentation for OAF, you need
gtk-doc and jade.
