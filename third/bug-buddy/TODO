         Select application; describe bug

 * Re-organize some code

 * Report a bug from inside the application (like monkeytalk patch from
   Ximian)

 * Add "kind of bug" first step --> Use different templates for 
   differents kinds

 * Add keywords and set severity based on kind of bug.

 * Submit bug via plugins and specifically for gnome, directly in xml via
   http post
