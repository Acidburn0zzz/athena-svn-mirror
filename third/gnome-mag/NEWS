What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.14:

* Fix for bug #166282; we now work properly if the source display size is
  smaller than the target display size.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.13:

* Fixes for #164444, #164371, #158468, #164175, #164491.

* Fixes for multi-DISPLAY and fullscreen support:
  we now accept setting target==source if not initially set equal;
  we correctly connect to source's DAMAGE events if source server isn't 
    the default GDK_DISPLAY;
  we tear down the zoom regions in the magnifier when changing source as
    well as target;
  we correctly reparent the magnifier's zoom regions _after_ redefining
    the magnifier's gtk-window;
  better lifecycle management of the zoom regions themselves, so that
    idle handlers and timeouts are removed when the regions are disposed.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.11:

* Fix crosswire trails when using DAMAGE and XFIXES, at least for
  smooth-scrolling mode (#160352).

* Reinstate crosswires, they were inadvertently removed by an error in 
  a compiler-warnings fix.

* Improved test for XFIXES and DAMAGE extensions, so that they 
  are properly built into gnome-mag when building on XOrg server platform.

* Fixed XFIXES cursor image support on big-endian architectures. (#159398)

* Fixes for #160352, #157187.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.9:

* different handling of changes to source and target displays;
  we don't try to reparent windows any more, we tear down and
  start over (works better with some x servers).

* Suppress a bunch of gdk critical warnings.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.8:

* bugfixes, sanity checks on client requests.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.7:

* magnifier's use of the new DAMAGE x extension can be turned off via
  the MAGNIFIER_IGNORE_DAMAGE environment variable, or via
  the "--ignore-damage" command line flag.  This is a debugging
  feature.

* magnifier now does some sanity checking on the setROI calls before 
  attempting to comply.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.6:

* Fix for bug 141376 and 152300; we now provide the missing epv
  implementation for getTargetDisplay and getSourceDisplay, and 
  we check to make sure we can connect to a display before
  trying to change source or target.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.5:

* We now implement LoginHelper from at-spi - this allows clients to
  tell that the magnifier needs access to certain resources during
  authentication, screen lock, etc., for instance allows magnifier to
  tell clients which X windows to raise in order to allow
  magnification when the screen is otherwise obscured.  Fixes bug #150846.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.4:

* Bugfixes for cursor painting if TARGET display has been changed (#140622)

* Improved support for DAMAGE; don't do global refresh/polling if
  DAMAGE extension is available.

* Can tell magnifier standalone to be OVERRIDE_REDIRECT if you need
  to. (See magnifier --usage).
 
* Set _NET_WM_STRUT and _NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL values; lets other apps
  know not to overlap the magnifier binary when run in split-screen mode.

* New translations:

- (or) Gora Mohanty
- (nb) Kjartan Marass
- (bs) CHristian Rose (ALL_LINGUAS addition only)

=========

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.2:

* Bugfix for cursor-size property.

* Added cursor-size test to tests/control-client.

=========

What's new in gnome-mag-0.11.1:

* fixed border-color property.

* Fixed setting of smooth-scroll policy and border-size.

* Fix for bug #104831; gnome-mag now listens for DAMAGE
  notifications when the DAMAGE extension is available at runtime
  (and build time).  This means that on DAMAGE-enabled servers, 
  gnome-mag's service need not use a timer-based refresh, 
  i.e. --refresh-timeout can be made arbitrarily large.

* Revamped the way cursor-sets are used; now cursor-set names
  refer to the names of directories under $share/gnome-mag/.
  
* gnome-mag can track changes to the source display's cursor and 
  display a rescaled cursor on the target display if XFIXES is
  available.  

* Added support for non-square cursor pixmaps.

Please see ChangeLog for more detail on these features.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.10.8:

* fix for builds with non-standard X directories. [bug 130787, from
  Fernando Herrera]

* smooth-scrolling is now the default.

* magnifier toplevel window is now TYPE_POPUP as it
  needs to be override-redirect and always on top.

* fixes to benchmarking code reports (Brian Cameron).

* cache GC's used in magnifier, to reduce X traffic (Brian Cameron).

* makefile cleanup: (Tomasz K³oczko)

What's new in gnome-mag-0.10.5:

* Improvements to test/benchmark output; 
  fixed a number of errors in compiling statistics.

* performance improvement due to cacheing GC's.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.10.4:

* new CLI options for performance benchmarking; 
  (See discussion in bugzilla bug #126825 for info on
  the new timing parameters, comments in 
  magnifier/zoom-region.c, and '--usage'.)

What's new in gnome-mag-0.10.2:

* Significant code cleanup and improvements to CLI.

* new languages: ja, pt, more.

* Fixes to 106067, 105298, 105820, 105205.

* Detect and survive out-of-memory conditions.

* Lots of build fixes.

What's new in gnome-mag-0.9.1:

* lots of translations, which is odd since there are (almost) no strings 
	:+)

* some fixes for cursor-coloring and hotspots;

* lots more implementation, for instance multiple zoom regions,
  control of onscreen cursor size and color, etc.  Also better
  support for fullscreen mode (though not perfect).

ISSUES: If you run in --fullscreen ("-f") mode, you must
  for the moment make sure that $DISPLAY matches "-t <target>",
  and you must explicitly specify both source ("-s") and
  target ("-t") on the command line when running the
  'magnifier' binary.

=============

This is the initial release of module gnome-mag,
which was previously included as part of module
at-spi.
