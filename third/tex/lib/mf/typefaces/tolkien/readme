	Find out from your local guru what settings to use for
running Metafont and where to install the fonts. On my PC for my
HP laserjet printer I use
	mf &plain \mode=hplaser; mag=1; input cirth
	For the other fonts just substitute cirbf (say) for cirth. For
more information on its use see cirth.tex.
	Comments and suggestions gratefully received. I have a germanic
rune font as well for rune enthusiasts. For Tolkien enthusiasts there is
a commonly available tengwar script font. I have a modification of this
giving roman letters. For the truly wierd I am working on a cuneiform
font two (64 letters done, 2946 to go!).
