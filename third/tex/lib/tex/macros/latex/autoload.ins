IMPORTANT COPYRIGHT NOTICE:

You are NOT ALLOWED to distribute this file alone.

You are allowed to distribute this file under the condition that it
is distributed together with all the files listed in manifest.txt.

If you receive only some of these files from someone, complain!


Permission is granted to copy this file to another file with a
clearly different name and to customize the declarations in that
copy to serve the needs of your installation, provided that you
comply with the conditions in the file legal.txt.

However, NO PERMISSION is granted to generate or to distribute a
modified version of this file under its original name.
 
You are NOT ALLOWED to change this file.


MODIFICATION ADVICE:

If you want to customize this file, it is best to make a copy of
the source file(s) from which it was produced.  Use a different
name for your copy(ies) and modify the copy(ies); this will ensure
that your modifications do not get overwritten when you install a
new release of the standard system.  You should also ensure that
your modified source file does not generate any modified file with
the same name as a standard file.

You can then easily distribute your modifications by distributing
the modified and renamed copy of the source file, taking care to
observe the conditions in legal.txt; this will ensure that other
users can safely use your modifications.

You will also need to produce your own, suitably named, .ins file to
control the generation of files from your source file; this file
should contain your own preambles for the files it generates, not
those in the standard .ins files.

The names of the source files used are shown above.
