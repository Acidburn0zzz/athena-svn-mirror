                  =========================================

                              31 August 1994

NOTE: LaTeX is installed and ready to use in OzTeX 1.7 and later.
If you have an older version of OzTeX then please upgrade.  Don't expect
any support if you decide to merge this release of LaTeX with an older
version of OzTeX!  If you have OzTeX 1.7 or later then you will only need
to read the following instructions if you decide to update the version of
LaTeX distributed with OzTeX.


SUMMARY
=======

This file contains instructions on how to install LaTeX for OzTeX.
Before reading this file, you should read install.txt which explains
how the LaTeX installation works in more detail.

The following sections describe:

 * How to save any old version of LaTeX.

 * How to unpack the LaTeX distribution.

 * How to create the LaTeX format.

 * How to check that the installation worked.

 * Removing unnecessary files.


SAVING ANY OLD VERSION OF LATEX
===============================

In OzTeX 1.7, `LaTeX' referred to LaTeX 2.09 and `LaTeX2e' referred to
the beta release of the new LaTeX implementation.  To encourage the idea
that LaTeX 2.09 is out of date and should gradually disappear, `LaTeX' is
now used to refer to the new LaTeX implementation.

If you have OzTeX 1.7 and you want to be able to use both LaTeX 2.09 and
the new LaTeX, then carry out the following steps:

 * In the `TeX-formats' folder, rename `LaTeX.fmt' to `LaTeX209.fmt' and
   delete `LaTeX2e.fmt' (you will be building a new `LaTeX.fmt' file).

 * In the `TeX-inputs' folder, rename the folder `LaTeX' to `LaTeX209'.
   Delete the `LaTeX2e' folder and create a new (empty) `LaTeX' folder.
   (If you'll be installing new versions of the psnfss and graphics packages
   then delete `PSNFSS2e' and `Graphics2e' as well and create new folders
   called `PSNFSS' and `Graphics'.  The installation steps for psnfss and
   graphics can be found in the documentation accompanying these packages.)

 * In the `Configs' folder, rename the `LaTeX' config file to `LaTeX209'
   and the `LaTeX2e' config file to `LaTeX'.  Edit these two config files
   and update the format list and TeX input folders to reflect the above new
   format names and TeX input folders.  Similar changes must be made to the
   format list and TeX input folders in the `Default' config file; you must
   also update the config list to show the new config file names.

In versions of OzTeX later than 1.7, the above steps are not needed because
only the new LaTeX implementation is distributed.  You should simply delete
all files in the `LaTeX' folder in `TeX-inputs' (after making a backup copy).


UNPACKING THE DISTRIBUTION
==========================

To unpack the LaTeX distribution:

 * Move all files in the distribution to the (empty) `LaTeX' folder in
   `TeX-inputs'.

 * Start up OzTeX.

 * Select `TeX...' from the `TeX' menu.

 * Use the standard file dialogue to select `unpack.ins', but do NOT open
   the file.  Instead, select `Cancel'.  This sets OzTeX's current folder.

 * Select `INITEX' from the `TeX' menu.

 * Type `unpack.ins' in response to the `**' prompt and hit Return.

This will start the unpacking process.  This may take some time:
about 3 hours on an SE, 50 minutes on a IIsi, 30 minutes on a Duo 230,
16 minutes on a IIfx or 10 minutes on a Quadra 840AV.

If you have a copy of MakeIndex, then move all files ending in `.ist'
to your MakeIndex folder.


CREATING THE LATEX FORMAT
=========================

To create the LaTeX format:

 * Select `INITEX' from the `TeX' menu.

 * Type `latex.ltx' in response to the `**' prompt and hit Return.

 * After a short while, you will be asked to save the LaTeX format.
   Save it as `LaTeX.fmt' in the `TeX-formats' folder.

You might discover at a later date that some of the TeX parameters in the
`Default' config file need to be increased to typeset your documents.
Depending on which parameters, you might need to build a new format file.
You might even need to build a "big" format; the OzTeX User Guide explains
how to do this.


CHECKING THAT THE INSTALLATION WORKED
=====================================

To check that the installation worked:

 * Move the file `ltxcheck.ltx' out of the `LaTeX' folder.
   (It doesn't matter where you move it, just so long as it is not in the
   same folder as the file `article.cls'.  If this file is in the same
   folder then LaTeX will definitely be able to read it and so cannot check
   if it is possible to read files that are NOT in the current folder.)

 * Tick the `LaTeX' format in the `TeX' menu.
   If you have LaTeX and LaTeX 2.09 then you should select `LaTeX' from the
   `Config' menu.  This will select the right format and the correct set of
   TeX input folders.

 * Select `TeX...' from the `TeX' menu.

 * Open the file `ltxcheck.ltx'.
   This will run a test of the LaTeX installation, and should produce `OK!'
   to a number of tests.  If it does not, then see `PROBLEMS' in install.txt.

 * Delete the .log and .aux files created (and move `ltxcheck.ltx' back to
   the `LaTeX' folder if you like).

You have now installed LaTeX!


REMOVING UNNECESSARY FILES
==========================

After LaTeX has been successfully installed, you might want to delete some
non-essential files (after making backup copies) to free up space on your
hard disk.  From the `LaTeX' folder, delete all files ending in:

   .ins .drv .dtx .fdd.
