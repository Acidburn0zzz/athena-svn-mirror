This file answers the following questions about installing xdvi:

    1.	I have font files cmr10.tfm, etc.  Why can't xdvi use them?
    2.	I can't seem to set the font path correctly.  Can you help me?
    3.	xdvi claims to support virtual fonts, but I can't use PostScript
	virtual fonts (such as helv.vf or phvr.vf) with xdvi.  Why not?
    4.	I am trying to display PostScript specials with -DPS_GS, but
	instead I get the message `gs: gs: Malformed ghostview color property.'
    5.	I am using gs 3.33 to render PostScript figures, but find that it
	cuts some off below or to the right of a certain point, and others
	are omitted entirely.
    6.	What is this "_get_wmShellWidgetClass undefined" error?

----------

1.  I have font files cmr10.tfm, etc.  Why can't xdvi use them?

tfm files contain only minimal information about the characters
in a font:  just the height, width, depth, and kerning and ligature
information.  To obtain information about the shapes of the
characters, xdvi needs pk or gf files.  (pxl files also contain
this information, but are obsolete.  There are utilities to convert
them to pk files though.)

----------

2.  I can't seem to set the font path correctly.  Can you help me?

Try
	xdvi -debug 32 file.dvi
to find out where xdvi is looking for the fonts.

----------

3.  xdvi claims to support virtual fonts, but I can't use PostScript
    virtual fonts (such as helv.vf or phvr.vf) with xdvi.  Why not?

The short answer is to quote the man page:

	Virtual fonts are also supported, although xdvi does not
	have any built-in fonts to which they can refer.

As further explanation, let me begin by pointing out:

	VIRTUAL FONTS ARE NOT FONTS.

Virtual fonts are recipes for building fonts from other fonts.
In the case of PostScript fonts, those other fonts reside on
your printer.  This is fine for dvi-to-PostScript programs
such as dvips, but it presents a problem for xdvi since it cannot
access your printer.

There are some solutions, however.

The first solution is to install gsftopk, which uses
ghostscript to approximate the fonts.  It is made for sites that
use both xdvi and dvips, although if you just use xdvi it should
be useful, too.

Another solution is to get these fonts pre-made in common sizes.
These were made by a program called gsrenderfont (part of the Gnu
font utilities).

These are all available via anonymous ftp:

gsftopk from math.berkeley.edu:pub/TeX/gsftopk.tar.Z
pre-made fonts from ftp.cs.umb.edu:pub/tex/psfonts.tar
gsrenderfont from prep.ai.mit.edu:pub/gnu/fontutils-0.6.tar.gz

----------

4.  I am trying to display PostScript specials with -DPS_GS, but
    instead I get the message `gs: gs: Malformed ghostview color property.'

xdvi needs at least version 2.6.2 of ghostscript.  It will also run with
ghostscript 2.6.1, provided you have applied fixes 1-4.  This particular
error message means that you are running gs 2.6.1 without fixes 1-4.
Probably you should get ghostscript 2.6.2 from prep.ai.mit.edu (or any of
its mirror sites).

xdvi will also run with version 3 of ghostscript, but see question #5.

----------

5.  I am using gs 3.33 to render PostScript figures, but find that it
    cuts some off below or to the right of a certain point, and others
    are omitted entirely.

You should apply the following patch.  This will also fix similar errors
with ghostview.  This patch supersedes a previous patch I have suggested
to some people.

6.  What is this "_get_wmShellWidgetClass undefined" error?

	In SunOS 4.1.2 Sun fixed a shared-library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way X builds the shared Xmu library, causing these symbols, notably,
to be undefined when building some X11 clients on SunOS 4.1.[23]:
	_get_wmShellWidgetClass
	_get_applicationShellWidgetClass
Compiling "-Bstatic -lXmu -Bdynamic" is overkill; be sure to set
OSTeenyVersion correctly in the config/sun.cf file and rebuild X11R5.

To solve the problem if you are using OpenWindows 3.0 (X11R4-based Xt), please
contact your local Sun office and request the following patches:

Patch i.d.      Description
100512-02       4.1.x OpenWindows 3.0 libXt Jumbo patch
100573-04       OpenWindows 3.0: xstdcmap fails to set XStandardColomap for
		24-bit machines [this also fixes bug 1087332, "With patched
		ld and libc, customer is getting undefined symbols"]

[Greg Earle, earle@Sun.COM; 7/92]

A source patch for use with the X11R4 libraries was developed by Conrad
Kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com); it retrofits into R4 some fixes made in R5 to
get around this problem. The patch is on ftp.x.org in [1/93]
