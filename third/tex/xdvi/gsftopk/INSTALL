			INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

gsftopk is primarily intended for sites using xdvi and dvips; it allows them
to use PostScript fonts with xdvi.  While there is nothing to prevent this
program from being used in other contexts, doing so would be difficult for
non-expert users.

(If you want to install gsftopk with Karl Berry's kpathsea library, see the
section "Installation with kpathsea" below.)

To install gsftopk, use the following steps.

1.  You _must_ have ghostscript 2.5.2 (or higher) installed on your system.

2.  It is recommended that you also have dvips installed; however, expert
    users can read the more detailed instructions at the end of this file
    to find out how to run without dvips.

3.  Edit the makefile according the instructions provided in the comments.

4.  You should now be able to just type "make" and "make install".
    This installs the gsftopk program, but does not yet set up xdvi to use it.
    *** if you are using one of the following platforms, then see the
	notes below.
		MIPS RC/6280 running RISCos 2
		HP-UX

5.  Edit the paths in xdvimakepk as you would for the MakeTeXPK script
    provided with dvips.  Also remember to correctly set the path for the
    psfonts.map file.  Install xdvimakepk in an appropriate location
    (probably the same directory as MakeTeXPK).

6.  Recompile xdvi with the flag -DMAKEPKCMD=\"xdvimakepk\" and install it.
    (Specifically, add the above flag to the definition of OPTIONDEFS in the
    Imakefile or Makefile and then "rm font_open.o" and "make" and install
    the binary.)  If your .dvi files use the virtual fonts provided with dvips,
    then you should remember to also set the DEFAULT_VF_PATH variable in the
    makefile.

You should now be able to use PostScript fonts with xdvi.

			NOTES FOR SPECIFIC PLATFORMS

*** RISCOS 2 ON MIPS RC/6280

Before running make, run the command

	setenv CC 'cc -systype svr4'

You will also need to edit config.h by hand, since ld(1) does not return
an error code.  You need to uncomment the line

	/* #define bzero(s, n)  memset((s), 0, (n)) */

*** HP-UX

Run "make hpux" instead of just plain "make" (unless you are using gcc,
in which case "make CC=gcc" would work).


			INSTALLATION WITH KPATHSEA

Read steps 1 and 2, above.

What follows assumes that the gsftopk directory is installed in the kpathsea
tools hierarchy: we assume that there is a ../kpathsea directory (as is
distributed in the xdvi, dvips, or web2c distributions from Karl Berry).
(You can eventually modify the installation in the top-level build directory
to automatically build in the gsftopk directory when building the tools.)

Run ./configure in this directory. This will generate a Makefile. Then simply
type 'make install' to install the program, its manual page, and the render.ps
file.

			NOTES FOR THE EXPERT

With a little extra work it is possible to install gsftopk without having
installed dvips.  All that is needed is to explain some of the makefile
variables and to describe the format of the file psfonts.map.

The CONFIGPATH is the directory where psfonts.map is to be stored.  It may
actually be a colon-separated list of paths, although only the first one
containing a file named ``psfonts.map'' is useful.

The HEADERDIR is the directory where the ``render.ps'' driver file is to
be stored; also it is a component of the HEADERPATH.  The HEADERPATH is a
colon-separated list of directories which are searched for files referenced
in the ``psfonts.map'' file.

Finally, the file ``psfonts.map'' should provide a information on how to access
each and every file gsftopk is to be expected to create.  Each line of that
file describes one font.  Each line consists of one or more fields, separated
by one or more tabs or spaces.  The first field is mandatory; it gives the
name by which TeX refers to the file.  Other fields are optional and are
order independent.  They are:

  o	The PS-name of the font.  If absent, it is the same as the TeX name.

  o	The file where the font is located.  This field is identified by
	preceding the file name with the character `<'.  If absent, it is
	assumed that the font is built-in to ghostscript.

  o	Special instructions for scaling the font.  This field is identified
	by enclosing it in quotes; it may therefore contains spaces.
	The field consists of PostScript instructions for modifying the font.
	Possibilities include "1.2 ExtendFont" to stretch the font horizontally
	by 20%, and ".3 SlantFont" to cause the letters to be slanted at a
	slope of .3.

The file may also contain comment lines.  These are blank lines, or lines
beginning with `;', `#', or `*'.

The following is a very abbreviated sample psfonts.map:

# Comment and blank lines are ignored.

rptmr	Times-Roman
Optima	<Optima.pfb
Optima-Slanted Optima <Optima.pfb ".1944 SlantFont"
Optima-Condensed Optima <Optima.pfb ".82 ExtendFont"
Optima-Extended Optima <Optima.pfb "1.2 ExtendFont"
