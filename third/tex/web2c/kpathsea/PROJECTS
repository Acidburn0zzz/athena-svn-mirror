Here are some planned future improvements.  If you would like to contribute,
send mail to me (karl@cs.umb.edu) first, so I can coordinate the work.


Configuration files so, e.g., $TEXMFROOT can get evaluated at runtime.

Make default paths have $TEXMFROOT -- means have to have some way to set
  the default for that at compilation, unless config files will do?

Do cd's in pathsrch, to keep the pathname length constant.

Separate the routines needed for path searching, and others that are here
  only because it's a common place -- i.e., a kutil library.

Do right thing if both (e.g.) DVIPSMAKEPK and MAKETEXPK are set.
