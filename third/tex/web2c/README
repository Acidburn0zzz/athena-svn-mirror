This directory contains various programs that use the kpathsea library
for path searching, and the library itself.

Please read the README and NEWS files in the subdirectories.

See the INSTALL files in the subdirectories for detailed installation
instructions, options, etc.  If you just want to go for it:

configure
make
make install
make distclean

This will install just the programs.  To install the library, 
(cd kpathsea; make install)

Report bugs in any software here, or suggestions in either the programs
or the documentation, no matter how small, to tex-k@cs.umb.edu.
(Email tex-k-request@cs.umb.edu with a line containing
subscribe your-preferred-email-address
in the body of the message to join this mailing list.)

The default installation prefix is the parent of the directory that
contains the program `tex', or /usr/local.

This is free software.  See the files COPYING* for copying permissions.
