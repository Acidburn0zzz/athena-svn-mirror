This is a terminal thing that isn't finished at all. See TODO.
Please do some of the things that are to do. ;-)

How it works
===

Profiles - 
  all settings are stored in profiles. prefs dialog edits the current
  profile

Session - 
  just the number of open windows/tabs and their profile is stored
  per-session
 
Command line options - 
  do not overlap things that are preferences
