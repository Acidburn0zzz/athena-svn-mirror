What's new in gnome-speech 0.2.4:

* Driver added for Cepstral Theta.

* All existing drivers were rewritten to share one instance of the TTS
  engine among all GNOME Speech Speaker objects created by the driver.
  Drivers which were rewritten include:
	* IBM Viavoice
	* Fonix DECTalk
	* Festival
	* FreeTTS

* All drivers were hacked to shutdown the server executeable when the
  SynthesisDriver object is destroyed.

* Memory leaks were fixed in test-speech.  Also two more tests were
  added:
	* Interrupt test-- tests speech interruption
	* Wait test-- tests the driver's ability to wait for speech to
	  finish.
