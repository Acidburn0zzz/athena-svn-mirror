Statement:

   The LPRng software has no known Year 2000 data dependencies.

   Where necessary,  dates are generated using values relative to
the UNIX Epoch,  and will be consistent to 2034 at a conservative
estimate.

   However,  since LPRng uses the RFC1179 standard for job and data file
transfer,  and other systems provide information in a form which may
not be consistent,  the LPRng author takes no reponsibility for other
defective implementations and the effects of using these defective
implementations with LPRng.

   Testing has been done on the following systems:
   1. BSDI UNIX, Version 3.0/3.1  (May 1998)
   2. FreeBSD 2.5  (July 1998)
   3. Red Hat Linux 5.1  (July 1998)
   4. Solaris 2.6 (Intel and Sparc Versions) (May 1998)

There were no observed problems with date formats using the LPRng
software in toto.  The software was NOT tested with the native LPD
or LP (system V) print spoolers.

Note: logging and other operations generate textual timestamps in
either a short (hh:mm) or extended (yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss) format.
The choice of short of extended formats is controlled by a simple
configuration option.
