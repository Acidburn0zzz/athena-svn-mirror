              Copyright Patrick Powell, Astart Technologies
                       <papowell@astart.com>

                         All rights reserved.

   NOTE: This license is not the same as any of the GNU Licenses
published by the Free Software Foundation. Its terms are substantially
different from those of the GNU Licenses. If you are familiar with the
GNU Licenses, please read this license with extra care.

   This License applies to the computer program known as "LPRng".  The
"Program", below, refers to such program, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work of the Program,
as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976, such as a
translation or a modification. The Program is a copyrighted work whose
copyright is held by Patrick Powell.

   This License does not apply when running "LPRng" on any Microsoft
operating system. Microsoft operating systems include all versions of
Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows.

   BY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE
PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL
ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE
PROGRAM OR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS
YOU PERMISSION TO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE
WORKS. THESE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE
TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.

  1. Licenses.

     Licensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you
     comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this License and
     provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this
     License with the Program:

       a. You may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies
          of the Program's source code as you receive it throughout the
          world, in any medium.

       b. You may modify the Program, create works based on the Program
          and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any
          medium.

  2. Restrictions.

     This license is subject to the following restrictions:
       a. Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program
          by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited
          if any payment is made in connection with such distribution,
          whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) or
          indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the
          Program, or payment for some product or service that includes
          a copy of the Program "without charge"; these are only
          examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited
          activities). However, the following methods of distribution
          involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a
          violation of this restriction:

            A. Posting the Program on a public access information
               storage and retrieval service for which a fee is
               received for retrieving information (such as an on-line
               service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent
               (i.e., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same
               volume of information consisting of random data).

            B. Distributing the Program on a CD-ROM, provided that the
               files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and
               verbatim on such CD-ROM, and provided further that all
               information on such CD-ROM be redistributable for
               non-commercial purposes without charge.

            C. As part of a distribution mechanism, include a set of
               patches or modifications to the programs that are applied
               as part of a configuration of installation procedure,
               as long as the patches are applied to the original
               software distribution,  or backout patches are provided
               to derive the original version from the backout version.

            D. As part of a distribution mechanism,  provide separate
               binary and source distributions,  provided that the binary
               distribution is simply a repackaging of the compiled form
               of the source distribution,  as specified by clause 1.C
               above.

       b. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification
          of the Program are not subject to this License and they are
          outside its scope.  Functional use (running) of the Program
          is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of
          the Program is not subject to this license.

       c. You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to
          the distribution of any work based on the Program:
            A. If you have modified the Program, you must cause your
               work to carry prominent notices stating that you have
               modified the Program's files and the date of any change;

            B. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
               that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
               Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole
               and at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
               this License;

            C. If the modified program normally reads commands
               interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time
               the modified program commences operation, to print or
               display an announcement including an appropriate
               copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty
               (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) when a
               copyright or other information is requested. Such
               notice must also state that users may redistribute the
               Program only under the conditions of this License and
               tell the user how to view the copy of this License
               included with the Program. (Exception: if the Program
               itself is interactive but does not normally print such
               an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
               required to print an announcement.);

            D. You must accompany any such work based on the Program
               with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
               code, delivered on a medium customarily used for
               software interchange. The source code for a work means
               the preferred form of the work for making modifications
               to it.  For an executable work, complete source code
               means all the source code for all modules it contains,
               plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
               scripts used to control compilation and installation of
               the executable code. However, the source code
               distributed need not include anything that is normally
               distributed (in either source or binary form) with the
               major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
               operating system on which the executable runs, unless
               that component itself accompanies the executable code;

            E. If you distribute any written or printed material at all
               with the Program or any work based on the Program, such
               material must include either a written copy of this
               License, or a prominent written indication that the
               Program or the work based on the Program is covered by
               this License and written instructions for printing
               and/or displaying the copy of the License on the
               distribution medium;

            F. You may not impose any further restrictions on the
               recipient's exercise of the rights granted herein.

               If distribution of executable or object code is made by
               offering the equivalent ability to copy from a
               designated place, then offering equivalent ability to
               copy the source code from the same place counts as
               distribution of the source code, even though third
               parties are not compelled to copy the source code along
               with the object code.

  3. Reservation of Rights.

     No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth
     herein. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
     Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the
     Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
     under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or
     rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  4. Other Restrictions.

     If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit
     geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
     that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
     excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation
     as if written in the body of this License.

  5. Limitations.

     THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS
     NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
     INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
     MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
     NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
     REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
     THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
     BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
     PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
     PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
     THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
