2. You will need to:

   Use GNU Make.  Don't even think about trying to use another
     make unless you are a Wizard.  And even the Wizards would
     download the GNU Make.
   Use an ANSI C compiler.

   READ the HOWTO/IFHP-HOWTO.{ps,html,text,...}.
      file(s) in the docs directory.
   At least read the section on installation.
  
   Then do the install.

   You have been warned.

3. Super Express Install For The Pathologically Impatient

   Right.  I know that you want to get going,  so here is the
   magic summary.

   configure
   make all
   # make install will:
   #  installs
   #    /usr/local/lib/filters/ifhp, links ofhp to ifhp,
   #    /usr/local/lib/filters/textps
   #    /usr/local/lib/filters/banner.ps
   make install
   #
   make init

    If you have an HP printer that support PJL, PCL, and PS, on a
    network connection, then simply change your printcap entries
    to have the form:

   lp:...
      :if=ifhp

4.  Run time options are provided by the /etc/ifhp.conf file.  This
    file is extremely complex,  as it has the ability to configure
    just about any option that you can think of.  See the IFHP-HOWTO
    file in the docs directory for details.

5.  By default, the if filter will check the job files for printability
    and/or postscript format.  If it is PostScript,  it will set the
    printer to PostScript mode using the PJL commands,  otherwise it
    will set the printer to PCL.  If you do not want this to happen,
    then print the job as a binary file;  this suppresses the checks.
    Some LPR spoolers use the 'v' format to indicate a binary file; If
    this is the case you will need to use the following printcap:

    printer:
        :of=/usr/local/lib/filters/ofhp:
        :if=/usr/local/lib/filters/ifhp:
        :vf=/usr/local/lib/filters/ifhp -c:

    If your LPD server does not allow options in the filter spec,
    use the following entry and the following shell script:
        :vf=/usr/local/lib/filters/vfhp.sy:
    vfhp.sh -
        #/bin/sh
        /usr/local/lib/filters/ifhp -c  $*

    In addition, you can 'suggest' a language using lpr -Zlanguage=xxx;
    this will prove helpful for those difficult files.

6. ifhp takes the full range of LPD filter options, and uses or
    or ignores them as applicable. The following command line options
    are used:
    -c  cleartext - dump this directly to the printer, no fonts,
        no nothing done.  For those desperate people trying to
        find a way to print those obnoxious files

        Invoke this using the lpr -b  (binary) command
    -sstatusfile    - the name of a status file that is updated with
        'rolling status' - i.e. - the last few log messages.
        The statusfile value is set from the 'ps=statusfile' printcap
        option
    -nuser, -hhost, -Jjob  - used by ofhp for banner printing defaults
    -T[filteroptions,]* - filter options
    -Z[filteroptions,]* - filter options
        See the ifhp man page for filteroption details.

7.  IFHP-HOWTO

    This is now the repository for all information on the IFHP filter.
    It is in the docs/IFHP-HOWTO directory,  and in several formats.
    Please read this before taking any other steps.

    Note:  there is even a simple tutorial session there, explaining how
    to set up some options for testing.
