Version 3.2.7
  Rearranged code in Read_write_timeout() so that a read of status is
  attempted BEFORE exiting on a write error.

  added pclbanner to the distribution

  IFHP recognizes the PJL 'reset' sequence and treats it as a
  'raw' or unprocessed job.  This allows you to send PJL jobs to the printer
  and not have them interpreted as PCL.

Version 3.2.6
  Added a console message for Lexmark and HP Printers that
    will be 'sticky' and stay visible after the job has been
    printed.
  (Provided by: Jason L Tibbitts III <tibbs@uh.edu>)

  Fixed up 'progress' so that it prints Kbytes correctly... sigh.


Version 3.2.5
  changed the a2ps options in ifhp.conf:
   -q -B -1 -M Letter --borders=no -o-
  (Suggested by: Jeff Gostin <jgostin@best.com>)

Version 3.2.5
  Cleaned up documentation,  made sure the various
  configuration and installation defaults were consistent.
  Ummm... and also removed a core dump from the distribution.
   Sigh...

Version 3.2.4
  Cleaned up Makefile.in so that running configure in another directory
   will be possible.  That is,
		cd ifhp...
		where=`pwd`
		mkdir ...
		cd ...
		sh $where/configure
   will now work correctly, and you can do a make install in $where 

  Added README.utilities and updated ifhp.conf file so that it has URL
    and ftp sites for file, enscript and a2ps tools.

  The phaser support did not work with OF and IF filters.
    More 'shutdowns' and clean up added.

  Sync and waitend made separate operations.
    You can now skip 'syncing' at the start,  but you 
    can force 'waitend'.  This is side effect of phaser
    operation.  You need to read status back from the printer until it closes
    the reverse connnection.  If you have appsocket with waitend,
    you will read status back until the job finishes.  If you do
    appsocket with waitend@,  you will get no status information for job.
    This is not good,  but gives you very fast throughput.

Version 3.2.3
  Updated Makefile.in so that when you do $(path)/configure for
   building in a separate directory,  the right files are found.

Version 3.2.2
  Added support for Tektronixs Phaser Printers -  using the appsocket protocol

Version 3.2.1

  Most of the code seems pretty stable,  so we start a new major release.
  There are mostly minor changes in the code for this release.
  
  Added 'PseudoMagicFilter Support' and got text to PS conversion
  working correctly.

    #
    # text conversion control
    #
    # control text to whatever conversion
    #
    # if you cannot find type, then try this file utility
    #
    # if the type is text and not supported on your system, do a conversion
    #  Method 1 - set 'default_language' as text, and run
    #    the program through a text to known converter
    #
    default_language=text
    text_converter=/usr/local/bin/a2ps -q -B -o-
    # output of the converter is pcl, ps, or raw
    text_converter_output=ps

    #
    #  Method 2 -
    #    Use the file util and match the output
    # file reports format information
    #  glob text_output_format text_converter
    #  - you do a glob match against pattern and use the converter
    #
    default_language=unknown
    file_util_path=/usr/bin/file -
    file_output_match = [
     *text*  ps /usr/local/bin/a2ps -q -B -o-
     ]
    # you need a temp file location
    tempfile=/var/tmp/ifhp

  Added a horrible horrible kludge that allows multiple fonts to be
  loaded.  You need to use:
    ifhp -Zfont=this,font=that,...
  which gets translated into font=this,that and the font handling code
  then works OK.

  Added a QMS1725 entry that just might work.
  Fixed up a couple of minor PostScript quirks.
  Added PJL support for duplex.

Version 3.1.20
  Documentation.  More Documentation.  More ...
  Sigh...
  
Version 3.1.19
  Made status messages less verbose.
  'trace_on_stderr' is now just 'trace' ... Sigh...

Version 3.1.17
  Changed CRLF back to not effective... Sigh.

Version 3.1.16
  Fixed a problem with testing short files for file type.
  (Noted by: Mike Whitson <mwhitson@MIT.EDU>)

  Added ledger paper types.  HP printers are very odd...
    (John McCash thinks so too)

  Made CRLF the default in ifhp.conf

Version 3.1.15
   Not distributed

Version 3.1.14

 ifhp.conf:
  pcl_pagesize \033&l#A - set page size
    Thu Feb  4 16:52:58 PST 1999
  remove_control=xyz...
    if PostScript AND you have a ^x, ^y, ^z, etc., remove it.
    Suggested use:  remove_control=CT removes CTRL-C, CTRL-T
    (Suggested by Mike Whitson <mwhitson@MIT.EDU>)

Version 3.1.6 - 3.1.13
   Lots and lots and lots of changes in ifhp.conf, etc, etc.
   Stable version approaching.

Version 3.1.5
   Experiments with various printers showed that the ifhp.conf
   file needed modification.

   Added a 'banner_only' mode for banner printing only.
  

Version 3.1.4
   Sun Dec 27 18:22:44 PST 1998
   Total rewrite of the ifhp software using a clean room
   approach.
