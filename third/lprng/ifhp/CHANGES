Version 3.2.1

  Most of the code seems pretty stable,  so we start a new major release.
  There are mostly minor changes in the code for this release.
  
  Added 'PseudoMagicFilter Support' and got text to PS conversion
  working correctly.

    #
    # text conversion control
    #
    # control text to whatever conversion
    #
    # if you cannot find type, then try this file utility
    #
    # if the type is text and not supported on your system, do a conversion
    #  Method 1 - set 'default_language' as text, and run
    #    the program through a text to known converter
    #
    default_language=text
    text_converter=/usr/local/bin/a2ps -q -B -o-
    # output of the converter is pcl, ps, or raw
    text_converter_output=ps

    #
    #  Method 2 -
    #    Use the file util and match the output
    # file reports format information
    #  glob text_output_format text_converter
    #  - you do a glob match against pattern and use the converter
    #
    default_language=unknown
    file_util_path=/usr/bin/file -
    file_output_match = [
     *text*  ps /usr/local/bin/a2ps -q -B -o-
     ]
    # you need a temp file location
    tempfile=/var/tmp/ifhp

  Added a horrible horrible kludge that allows multiple fonts to be
  loaded.  You need to use:
    ifhp -Zfont=this,font=that,...
  which gets translated into font=this,that and the font handling code
  then works OK.

  Added a QMS1725 entry that just might work.
  Fixed up a couple of minor PostScript quirks.
  Added PJL support for duplex.

Version 3.1.20
  Documentation.  More Documentation.  More ...
  Sigh...
  
Version 3.1.19
  Made status messages less verbose.
  'trace_on_stderr' is now just 'trace' ... Sigh...

Version 3.1.17
  Changed CRLF back to not effective... Sigh.

Version 3.1.16
  Fixed a problem with testing short files for file type.
  (Noted by: Mike Whitson <mwhitson@MIT.EDU>)

  Added ledger paper types.  HP printers are very odd...
    (John McCash thinks so too)

  Made CRLF the default in ifhp.conf

Version 3.1.15
   Not distributed

Version 3.1.14

 ifhp.conf:
  pcl_pagesize \033&l#A - set page size
    Thu Feb  4 16:52:58 PST 1999
  remove_control=xyz...
    if PostScript AND you have a ^x, ^y, ^z, etc., remove it.
    Suggested use:  remove_control=CT removes CTRL-C, CTRL-T
    (Suggested by Mike Whitson <mwhitson@MIT.EDU>)

Version 3.1.6 - 3.1.13
   Lots and lots and lots of changes in ifhp.conf, etc, etc.
   Stable version approaching.

Version 3.1.5
   Experiments with various printers showed that the ifhp.conf
   file needed modification.

   Added a 'banner_only' mode for banner printing only.
  

Version 3.1.4
   Sun Dec 27 18:22:44 PST 1998
   Total rewrite of the ifhp software using a clean room
   approach.
