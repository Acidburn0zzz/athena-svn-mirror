><H3
>GNOME VFS URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)</H3
><P
>The GNOME Virtual file system uses URIs similiar to the
        standard WWW URIs.  The basic difference between a VFS URI and
        WWW URI is that, while with WWW URIs you can only use a single
        protocol for accessing a certain file, with GNOME VFS URIs you
        can combine different access methods in sequence.</P
><P
>For example, suppose you want to access file
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hello.c</TT
> in a <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar.gz</TT
>
        file which is in turn accessible through FTP from a remote
        machine.  In order to access this file, you would need to:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Connect to the FTP site.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Fetch the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar.gz</TT
>
        file.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Decompress the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar.gz</TT
> file using
          GZIP.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Extract <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>hello.c</TT
> from the resulting
          uncompressed <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>tar</TT
> file.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>The GNOME Virtual File System lets you express this by
        combining the three access methods (i.e. tar, GZIP and FTP)
        into a single URI.  Access methods are combined in the URI by
        using the `#' character, followed by the name for the access
        method and the subpath for that specific access method.  The
        subpath can be omitted for those storage methods that do not
        need a path to retrieve the file.  (For example, a GZIP file
        always contains a single uncompressed file, so no path is
        needed to locate the uncompressed file within the GZIP file.
        But on the other hand, the TAR method requires a path to
        locate a specific file or directory.)</P
><P
>For example, in the case we outlined above, the URI would
        look something like:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;        ftp://username:password@host.net/path/to/file.tar.gz#gzip#tar/path/to/hello.c</PRE
><P
>Each method/subpath couple is called a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>URI
      element</I
>.  When URI elements are combined like this,
      each URI element uses the previous one to access a base resource
      into which it will look up a file, using the subpath
      information.  For this reason, we will say that each element is
      the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>parent</I
> element for the following one.</P
><P
>The first URI element, the one which has no parent, is
      called the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>toplevel element</I
>.  It does not
      use the `#' character; instead, it uses the standard syntax of
      WWW URIs: </P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;        method://user:password@host/path/to/file</PRE
><P
>This way, normal WWW URIs can be used with the GNOME Virtual
      File System.</P
><P
>Toplevel elements are also special because they let users
        specify user names, passwords and host names, while
        non-toplevel elements don't.</P

>GNOME Virtual File System access method implementation</H2
><P
>In the GNOME Virtual File System, the implementations for
    all the access methods are loaded at runtime, as shared library
    modules.  The modules are loaded during parsing of the string URI:
    if the parser encounters an access method for which no
    implementation is currently loaded, it retrieves the corresponding
    library file, dynamically links it into the executable, and
    initializes it.</P
><P
>After initialization, the module returns a special
    <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>GnomeVFSMethod</SPAN
> object that contains
    pointers to the various implementation functions for that specific
    method.  By storing a pointer to this object into the
    <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>GnomeVFSURI</SPAN
> type, the VFS library is then
    able to use these functions for file access.</P
><DIV
CLASS="REFSECT2"
><A
NAME="AEN7650"

><H3
>How file access is performed</H3
><P
>When the VFS library needs to perform some file operation,
      it performs the following steps:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>If the URI is given in textual form (i.e. as a
        string), it parses it and activates the necessary access method
        modules.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It retrieves a pointer to the lowmost
        level URI element.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It retrieves a pointer to the
        <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>GnomeVFSMethod</SPAN
> object that corresponds
        to the access method for that URI element.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It retrieves a pointer to the implementation
        function for that operation from the
        <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>GnomeVFSMethod</SPAN
>object.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>It invokes that implementation function
        passing the pointer to the lowmost level URI
        element.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>Combining the access methods is always done within the
      method implementation.  If the method implementation needs to do
      some file operation on the the parent URI element, it can do so
      by simply invoking the corresponding VFS function in, by using
      the parent pointer in the <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>GnomeVFSURI</SPAN
>
      object. </P
><P
>For example, suppose you have to read a simple URI like
      the following:</P
><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>&#13;        file:/home/ettore/file.gz#gzip</PRE
><P
>In this case, the GZIP method will be invoked with a
      pointer to the <SPAN
CLASS="STRUCTNAME"
>GnomeVFSURI</SPAN
> describing the
      `gzip' part; then the GZIP method will be able to read
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>file.gz</TT
> by just invoking the corresponding
      GNOME VFS library function on its parent, and decompress it on
      the fly. </P

>Using shared libraries</H3

><P
>The current way for accessing the right module for the
      right method is very simple, and is based on file names.  In
      practice, a module implementing access method named
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>foo</TT
> must be named
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libfoo.so</TT

      implementing the <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>ftp:</TT
> access method is
      called <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>libftp.so</TT
>, the module implementing
      <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>#gzip</TT

      <TT

      The reason for this is that the asynchronous GNOME VFS engine
      will use threads when available; if you don't make sure that the
      code is thread-safe, every kind of weird and unexpected errors
      will happen.  As debugging these problems can be very hard, it's
      important to write the code with threads in mind right from the
      start.</P

><P
>Although it might sound scary at first, making the code
      for the modules thread safe is not complicated at all.</P
><P
>First of all, make sure the amount of global variables is
      kept to the bare minimum.  If possible, you should avoid them at
      all cost.</P
><P
>For those cases where globals are inevitable (such as
      caches, connection pools or things like that), you have to make
      sure every variable is properly associated with a mutex, and
      that the mutex is locked before every access to this variable
      and released afterwards.  You can also use
      <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>G_LOCK_DEFINE_STATIC</TT
>,
      <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>G_LOCK</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>G_UNLOCK</TT
>
      for this.
      </P
><P
>Generally speaking, if you are going to dynamically
      allocate structures that are shared by more than one
      operation/file, you should provide all of them with their nice
      mutex locks.</P
><P
>Finally, make sure mutexes are used only if they are
      available.  One way to do so is to use macros like the
      following:</P
><PRE

#define MUTEX_FREE(a)   g_mutex_free (a)

#define MUTEX_UNLOCK(a) if ((a) != NULL) g_mutex_unlock (a)
#else
#define MUTEX_NEW()     NULL

      <TT
CLASS="FUNCTION"

CLASS="FUNCTION"
>G_UNLOCK</TT

      GLib are always safe to use, as they are already defined to be
      nothing when thread support is not available.</P

      private GNOME VFS API that does this stuff for all the
