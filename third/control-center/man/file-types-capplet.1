.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBfile-types-capplet\fR This capplet allows you to
configure how files of various types should be handled. File type
(formally called MIME type) describes what kind of data and in what
format the file contains. For each of the file types, you can set the
icon to be used by the File Manager, the default application to be
used to open files of this type, etc. For example, file type
image/jpeg is used for image files in JPEG format; by default, it is
opened using File Manager's built-in graphics viewer.
