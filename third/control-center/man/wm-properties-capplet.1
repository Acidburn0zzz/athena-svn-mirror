.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBwm-properties-capplet\fR [ \fBNo options\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBwm-properties-capplet\fR Because Gnome is not dependent on
any one window manager this capplet allows you to select which window
manager you wish to use. The Window Manager capplet only shows
Gnome-compliant window managers; if you want to use other window
managers, you have to tell Window Manager capplet about them.
