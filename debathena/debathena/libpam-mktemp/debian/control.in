Description: PAM module to create temporary session files
 This PAM module securely creates a temporary file or directory with
 mkstemp, and sets an environment variable to point to its location.
 .
 A common use is to set the XAUTHORITY environment variable to a
 securely created temporary file, for use when home directories are in
 a networked filesystem.
